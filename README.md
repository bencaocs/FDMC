### Summary

We introduce Frequency Dictionary Mapping Coding, and achieve handle-level random access in DNA storage, bridging the gap between carbon-based storage media and silicon-based ones.

### Abstract

DNA storage is characterized by high storage density and durability, but the existing DNA storage system has a high latency, and lacks the consideration of data security. In order to improve the availability of DNA storage, this paper proposes that Frequency Dictionary Mapping Coding (FDMC) implements handle-level random access in DNA Archival storage, and a hybrid e-molecular encryption strategy and multi-level error correction algorithm are provided to ensure data security and integrity. The results of the simulation and wet experiments demonstrate that FDMC can achieve handle-level random access in lossless encrypted DNA storage systems, which balances security and robustness. Even in the extreme case of DNA sequence loss of 10%, it can still recover 91.74% of the original data while ensuring storage density above 1.80 bits/nt. In summary, FDMC improves the application range of DNA as a storage medium and bridges the gap between DNA storage and traditional storage modes.
