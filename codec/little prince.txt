The Little Prince

Antoine de Saint-Exup¨¦ry
Translated by Katherine WoodsI ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up o I have a serious reason o he is the best friend I have in the world o I have another reason o this grown-up understands everything e even books about children o I have a third reason o he lives in France where he is hungry and cold o He needs cheering up o If all these reasons are not enough e I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew o All grown-ups were once children o although few of them remember it o And so I correct my dedication o 
Chapter I Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book e called True Stories from Nature e about the primeval forest o It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal o Here is a copy of the drawing o 
In the book it said o Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole e without chewing it o After that they are not able to move e and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion o 
I pondered deeply e then e over the adventures of the jungle o And after some work with a coloured pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing o My Drawing Number One o It looked like this o I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups e and asked them whether the drawing frightened them o 
But they answered o Frighten o Why should any one be frightened by a hat o 
My drawing was not a picture of a hat o It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant o But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it e I made another drawing o I drew the inside of the boa constrictor e so that the grown-ups could see it clearly o They always need to have things explained o My Drawing Number Two looked like this o The grown-ups' response e this time e was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors e whether from the inside or the outside e and devote myself instead to geography e history e arithmetic and grammar o That is why e at the age of six e I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter o I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two o Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves e and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them o 
So then I chose another profession e and learned to pilot airplanes o I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me o At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona o If one gets lost in the night e such knowledge is valuable o 
In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence o I have lived a great deal among grown-ups o I have seen them intimately e close at hand o And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them o 
Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted e I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One e which I have always kept o I would try to find out e so e if this was a person of true understanding o But e whoever it was e he e or she e would always say o That is a hat o 
Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors e or primeval forests e or stars o I would bring myself down to his level o I would talk to him about bridge e and golf e and politics e and neckties o And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man o Chapter IISo I lived my life alone e without anyone that I could really talk to e until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara e six years ago o Something was broken in my engine o And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers e I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone o It was a question of life or death for me o I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week o The first night e then e I went to sleep on the sand e a thousand miles from any human habitation o I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean o Thus you can imagine my amazement e at sunrise e when I was awakened by an odd little voice o It said o 
If you please o draw me a sheep o 
What o 
Draw me a sheep o 
I jumped to my feet e completely thunderstruck o I blinked my eyes hard o I looked carefully all around me o And I saw a most extraordinary small person e who stood there examining me with great seriousness o Here you may see the best portrait that e later e I was able to make of him o But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model o That e however e is not my fault o The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old e and I never learned to draw anything e except boas from the outside and boas from the inside o 
Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment o Remember e I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region o And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands e nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear o Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert e a thousand miles from any human habitation o When at last I was able to speak e I said to him o 
But o what are you doing here o 
And in answer he repeated e very slowly e as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence o 
If you please o draw me a sheep o 
When a mystery is too overpowering e one dare not disobey o Absurd as it might seem to me e a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death e I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain pen o But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography e history e arithmetic e and grammar e and I told the little chap (a little crossly e too that I did not know how to draw o He answered me o 
That doesn't matter o Draw me a sheep o 
But I had never drawn a sheep o So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often o It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside o And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with e
No e no e no o I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor o A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature e and an elephant is very cumbersome o Where I live e everything is very small o What I need is a sheep o Draw me a sheep o 
So then I made a drawing o He looked at it carefully e then he said o 
No o This sheep is already very sickly o Make me another o 
So I made another drawing o My friend smiled gently and indulgently o 
You see yourself e he said e that this is not a sheep o This is a ram o It has horns o 
So then I did my drawing over once more o But it was rejected too e just like the others o 
This one is too old o I want a sheep that will live a long time o 
By this time my patience was exhausted e because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart o 
So I tossed off this drawing o And I threw out an explanation with it o This is only his box o The sheep you asked for is inside o 
I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge o 
That is exactly the way I wanted it o Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass o 
Why o 
Because where I live everything is very small o 
There will surely be enough grass for him e I said o It is a very small sheep that I have given you o 
He bent his head over the drawing o 
Not so small that o Look o He has gone to sleep o 
And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince o Chapter III
It took me a long time to learn where he came from o The little prince e who asked me so many questions e never seemed to hear the ones I asked him o It was from words dropped by chance that e little by little e everything was revealed to me o 
The first time he saw my airplane e for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me e he asked me o 
What is that object o 
That is not an object o It flies o It is an airplane o It is my airplane o 
And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly o 
He cried out e then o 
What o You dropped down from the sky o 
Yes e I answered e modestly o 
Oh o That is funny o 
And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter e which irritated me very much o I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously o 
Then he added o 
So you e too e come from the sky o Which is your planet o At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded e abruptly o 
Do you come from another planet o 
But he did not reply o He tossed his head gently e without taking his eyes from my plane o 
It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away o And he sank into a reverie e which lasted a long time o Then e taking my sheep out of his pocket e he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure o 
You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the other planets o I made a great effort e therefore e to find out more on this subject o 
My little man e where do you come from o What is this 'where I live e' of which you speak o Where do you want to take your sheep o 
After a reflective silence he answered o 
The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house o 
That is so o And if you are good I will give you a string e too e so that you can tie him during the day e and a post to tie him to o 
But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer o 
Tie him o What a queer idea o 
But if you don't tie him e I said e he will wander off somewhere e and get lost o 
My friend broke into another peal of laughter o 
But where do you think he would go o 
Anywhere o Straight ahead of him o 
Then the little prince said e earnestly o 
That doesn't matter o Where I live e everything is so small o 
And e with perhaps a hint of sadness e he added o 
Straight ahead of him e nobody can go very far o Chapter IVI had thus learned a second fact of great importance o this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house o 
But that did not really surprise me much o I knew very well that in addition to the great planets o such as the Earth e Jupiter e Mars e Venus o to which we have given names e there are also hundreds of others e some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope o When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name e but only a number o He might call it e for example e Asteroid 325 o 
I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612 o 
This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope o That was by a Turkish astronomer e in 1909 o On making his discovery e the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress e in a great demonstration o But he was in Turkish costume e and so nobody would believe what he said o 
Grown-ups are like that o Fortunately e however e for the reputation of Asteroid B-612 e a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects e under pain of death e should change to European costume o So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again e dressed with impressive style and elegance o And this time everybody accepted his report o If I have told you these details about the asteroid e and made a note of its number for you e it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways o When you tell them that you have made a new friend e they never ask you any questions about essential matters o They never say to you e What does his voice sound like o What games does he love best o Does he collect butterflies o Instead e they demand o How old is he o How many brothers has he o How much does he weigh o How much money does his father make o Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him o 
If you were to say to the grown-ups o I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick e with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof e they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all o You would have to say to them o I saw a house that cost $20 e000 o Then they would exclaim o Oh e what a pretty house that is o 
Just so e you might say to them o The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming e that he laughed e and that he was looking for a sheep o If anybody wants a sheep e that is a proof that he exists o And what good would it do to tell them that o They would shrug their shoulders e and treat you like a child o But if you said to them o The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612 e then they would be convinced e and leave you in peace from their questions o 
They are like that o One must not hold it against them o Children should always show great forbearance toward grown-up people o 
But certainly e for us who understand life e figures are a matter of indifference o I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales o I should have like to say o Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself e and who had need of a sheep o 
To those who understand life e that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story o 
For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly o I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories o Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me e with his sheep o If I try to describe him here e it is to make sure that I shall not forget him o To forget a friend is sad o Not every one has had a friend o And if I forget him e I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures o 
It is for that purpose e again e that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils o It is hard to take up drawing again at my age e when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside e since I was six o I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible o But I am not at all sure of success o One drawing goes along all right e and another has no resemblance to its subject o I make some errors e too e in the little prince's height o in one place he is too tall and in another too short o And I feel some doubts about the colours of his costume o So I fumble along as best I can e now good e now bad e and I hope generally fair-to-middling o 
In certain more important details I shall make mistakes e also o But that is something that will not be my fault o My friend never explained anything to me o He thought e perhaps e that I was like himself o But I e alas e do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes o Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups o I have had to grow old o Chapter VAs each day passed I would learn e in our talk e something about the little prince's planet e his departure from it e his journey o The information would come very slowly e as it might chance to fall from his thoughts o It was in this way that I heard e on the third day e about the catastrophe of the baobabs o 
This time e once more e I had the sheep to thank for it o For the little prince asked me abruptly o as if seized by a grave doubt o It is true e isn't it e that sheep eat little bushes o 
Yes e that is true o 
Ah o I am glad o 
I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes o But the little prince added o 
Then it follows that they also eat baobabs o 
I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes e but e on the contrary e trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him e the herd would not eat up one single baobab o 
The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh o 
We would have to put them one on top of the other e he said o But he made a wise comment o 
Before they grow so big e the baobabs start out by being little o 
That is strictly correct e I said o But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs o 
He answered me at once e Oh e come e come o  e as if he were speaking of something that was self-evident o And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem e without any assistance o 
Indeed e as I learned e there were on the planet where the little prince lived o as on all planets o good plants and bad plants o In consequence e there were good seeds from good plants e and bad seeds from bad plants o But seeds are invisible o They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's darkness e until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken o Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin o timidly at first o to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun o If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush e one would let it grow wherever it might wish o But when it is a bad plant e one must destroy it as soon as possible e the very first instant that one recognizes it o 
Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab o The soil of that planet was infested with them o A baobab is something you will never e never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late o It spreads over the entire planet o It bores clear through it with its roots o And if the planet is too small e and the baobabs are too many e they split it in pieces o It is a question of discipline e the little prince said to me later on o When you've finished your own toilet in the morning e then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet e just so e with the greatest care o You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs e at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth o It is very tedious work e the little prince added e but very easy o 
And one day he said to me o You ought to make a beautiful drawing e so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is o That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day o Sometimes e he added e there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day o But when it is a matter of baobabs e that always means a catastrophe o I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man o He neglected three little bushes o 
So e as the little prince described it to me e I have made a drawing of that planet o I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist o But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood e and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid e that for once I am breaking through my reserve o Children e I say plainly e watch out for the baobabs o My friends e like myself e have been skirting this danger for a long time e without ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing o The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me o 
Perhaps you will ask me e Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs o 
The reply is simple o I have tried o But with the others I have not been successful o When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity o Chapter VIOh e little prince o Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life o For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset o I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day e when you said to me o 
I am very fond of sunsets o Come e let us go look at a sunset now o 
But we must wait e I said o 
Wait o For what o 
For the sunset o We must wait until it is time o 
At first you seemed to be very much surprised o And then you laughed to yourself o You said to me o 
I am always thinking that I am at home o 
Just so o Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France o 
If you could fly to France in one minute e you could go straight into the sunset e right from noon o Unfortunately e France is too far away for that o But on your tiny planet e my little prince e all you need do is move your chair a few steps o You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you like o 
One day e you said to me e I saw the sunset forty-four times o 
And a little later you added o 
You know o one loves the sunset e when one is so sad o 
Were you so sad e then o I asked e on the day of the forty-four sunsets o 
But the little prince made no reply o 
Chapter VIIOn the fifth day o again e as always e it was thanks to the sheep o the secret of the little prince's life was revealed to me o Abruptly e without anything to lead up to it e and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on his problem e he demanded o 
A sheep o if it eats little bushes e does it eat flowers e too o 
A sheep e I answered e eats anything it finds in its reach o 
Even flowers that have thorns o 
Yes e even flowers that have thorns o 
Then the thorns o what use are they o 
I did not know o At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine o I was very much worried e for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious o And I had so little drinking water left that I had to fear for the worst o The thorns o what use are they o 
The little prince never let go of a question e once he had asked it o As for me e I was upset over that bolt o And I answered with the first thing that came into my head o 
The thorns are of no use at all o Flowers have thorns just for spite o 
Oh o 
There was a moment of complete silence o Then the little prince flashed back at me e with a kind of resentfulness o 
I don't believe you o Flowers are weak creatures o They are naive o They reassure themselves as best they can o They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons o 
I did not answer o At that instant I was saying to myself o If this bolt still won't turn e I am going to knock it out with the hammer o Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts o 
And you actually believe that the flowers o 
Oh e no o I cried o No e no no o I don't believe anything o I answered you with the first thing that came into my head o Don't you see o I am very busy with matters of consequence o 
He stared at me e thunderstruck o 
Matters of consequence o 
He looked at me there e with my hammer in my hand e my fingers black with engine-grease e bending down over an object e which seemed to him extremely ugly o 
You talk just like the grown-ups o 
That made me a little ashamed o But he went on e relentlessly o 
You mix everything up together o You confuse everything o 

He was really very angry o He tossed his golden curls in the breeze o 
I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman o He has never smelled a flower o He has never looked at a star o He has never loved any one o He has never done anything in his life but add up figures o And all day he says over and over e just like you o 'I am busy with matters of consequence o ' And that makes him swell up with pride o But he is not a man o he is a mushroom o 
A what o 
A mushroom o 
The little prince was now white with rage o 
The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years o For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same o And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns e which are never of any use to them o Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important o Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman's sums o And if I know o I e myself o one flower which is unique in the world e which grows nowhere but on my planet e but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning e without even noticing what he is doing o Oh o You think that is not important o 
His face turned from white to red as he continued o 
If some one loves a flower e of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars e it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars o He can say to himself e 'Somewhere e my flower is there o ' But if the sheep eats the flower e in one moment all his stars will be darkened o And you think that is not important o He could not say anything more o His words were choked by sobbing o 
The night had fallen o I had let my tools drop from my hands o Of what moment now was my hammer e my bolt e or thirst e or death o On one star e one planet e my planet e the Earth e there was a little prince to be comforted o I took him in my arms e and rocked him o I said to him o 
The flower that you love is not in danger o I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep o I will draw you a railing to put around your flower o I will o 
I did not know what to say to him o I felt awkward and blundering o I did not know how I could reach him e where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more o 
It is such a secret place e the land of tears o Chapter VIIII soon learned to know this flower better o On the little prince's planet the flowers had always been very simple o They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody o One morning they would appear in the grass e and by night they would have faded peacefully away o But one day e from a seed blown from no one knew where e a new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet o It might e you see e have been a new kind of baobab o 
The shrub soon stopped growing e and began to get ready to produce a flower o The little prince e who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud e felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it o But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber o She chose her colours with the greatest care o She adjusted her petals one by one o She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled e like the field poppies o It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear o Oh e yes o She was a coquettish creature o And her mysterious adornment lasted for days and days o 
Then one morning e exactly at sunrise e she suddenly showed herself o 
And e after working with all this painstaking precision e she yawned and said o Ah o I am scarcely awake o I beg that you will excuse me o My petals are still all disarranged o 
But the little prince could not restrain his admiration o 
Oh o How beautiful you are o 
Am I not o the flower responded e sweetly o And I was born at the same moment as the sun o 

The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest o but how moving o and exciting o she was o 
I think it is time for breakfast e she added an instant later o If you would have the kindness to think of my needs o 
And the little prince e completely abashed e went to look for a sprinkling-can of fresh water o So e he tended the flower o So e too e she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity o which was e if the truth be known e a little difficult to deal with o One day e for instance e when she was speaking of her four thorns e she said to the little prince o 
Let the tigers come with their claws o 
There are no tigers on my planet e the little prince objected o And e anyway e tigers do not eat weeds o 
I am not a weed e the flower replied e sweetly o 
Please excuse me o 
I am not at all afraid of tigers e she went on e but I have a horror of drafts o I suppose you wouldn't have a screen for me o A horror of drafts o that is bad luck e for a plant e remarked the little prince e and added to himself e This flower is a very complex creature o 
At night I want you to put me under a glass globe o It is very cold where you live o In the place I came from o But she interrupted herself at that point o She had come in the form of a seed o She could not have known anything of any other worlds o Embarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a na?ve untruth e she coughed two or three times e in order to put the little prince in the wrong o 
The screen o 
I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me o 
Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same o 
So the little prince e in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love e had soon come to doubt her o He had taken seriously words e which were without importance e and it made him very unhappy o 
I ought not to have listened to her e he confided to me one day o One never ought to listen to the flowers o One should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance o Mine perfumed all my planet o But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace o This tale of claws e which disturbed me so much e should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity o 
And he continued his confidences o 
The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything o I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words o She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me o I ought never to have run away from her o I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little stratagems o Flowers are so inconsistent o But I was too young to know how to love her o Chapter IXI believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds o On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order o He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes o He possessed two active volcanoes; and they were very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning o He also had one volcano that was extinct o But e as he said e One never knows o So he cleaned out the extinct volcano e too o If they are well cleaned out e volcanoes burn slowly and steadily e without any eruptions o Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney o 
On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes o That is why they bring no end of trouble upon us o The little prince also pulled up e with a certain sense of dejection e the last little shoots of the baobabs o He believed that he would never want to return o But on this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him o And when he watered the flower for the last time e and prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe e he realised that he was very close to tears o Goodbye e he said to the flower o 
But she made no answer o 
Goodbye e he said again o 
The flower coughed o But it was not because she had a cold o 
I have been silly e she said to him e at last o I ask your forgiveness o Try to be happy o 
He was surprised by this absence of reproaches o He stood there all bewildered e the glass globe held arrested in mid-air o He did not understand this quiet sweetness o 
Of course I love you e the flower said to him o It is my fault that you have not known it all the while o That is of no importance o But you o you have been just as foolish as I o Try to be happy o let the glass globe be o I don't want it any more o 
But the wind o 
My cold is not so bad as all that o the cool night air will do me good o I am a flower o 
But the animals o 
Well e I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies o It seems that they are very beautiful o And if not the butterflies o and the caterpillars o who will call upon me o You will be far away o as for the large animals o I am not at all afraid of any of them o I have my claws o 
And e na?vely e she showed her four thorns o Then she added o 
Don't linger like this o You have decided to go away o Now go o 
For she did not want him to see her crying o She was such a proud flower o Chapter XHe found himself in the neighbourhood of the asteroids 325 e 326 e 327 e 328 e 329 e and 330 o He began e therefore e by visiting them e in order to add to his knowledge o 
The first of them was inhabited by a king o Clad in royal purple and ermine e he was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple and majestic o 
Ah o Here is a subject e exclaimed the king e when he saw the little prince coming o 
And the little prince asked himself o 
How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before o 
He did not know how the world is simplified for kings o To them e all men are subjects o 
Approach e so that I may see you better e said the king e who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody o The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king's magnificent ermine robe o So he remained standing upright e and e since he was tired e he yawned o 
It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king e the monarch said to him o I forbid you to do so o 
I can't help it o I can't stop myself e replied the little prince e thoroughly embarrassed o I have come on a long journey e and I have had no sleep o 
Ah e then e the king said o I order you to yawn o It is years since I have seen anyone yawning o Yawns e to me e are objects of curiosity o Come e now o Yawn again o It is an order o 
That frightens me o I cannot e any more o murmured the little prince e now completely abashed o 
Hum o Hum o replied the king o Then I o I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to o 

He sputtered a little e and seemed vexed o 
For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected o He tolerated no disobedience o He was an absolute monarch o But e because he was a very good man e he made his orders reasonable o 
If I ordered a general e he would say e by way of example e if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird e and if the general did not obey me e that would not be the fault of the general o It would be my fault o 
May I sit down o came now a timid inquiry from the little prince o 
I order you to do so e the king answered him e and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle o 
But the little prince was wondering o The planet was tiny o Over what could this king really rule o 
Sire e he said to him e I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question o 
I order you to ask me a question e the king hastened to assure him o 
Sire o over what do you rule o 
Over everything e said the king e with magnificent simplicity o 
Over everything o 
The king made a gesture e which took in his planet e the other planets e and all the stars o 
Over all that o asked the little prince o 
Over all that e the king answered o 
For his rule was not only absolute o it was also universal o 
And the stars obey you o 
Certainly they do e the king said o They obey instantly o I do not permit insubordination o 
Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at o If he had been master of such complete authority e he would have been able to watch the sunset e not forty-four times in one day e but seventy-two e or even a hundred e or even two hundred times e without ever having to move his chair o And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet e which he had forsaken e he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favour o 
I should like to see a sunset o do me that kindness o Order the sun to set o 
If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly e or to write a tragic drama e or to change himself into a sea bird e and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received e which one of us would be in the wrong o the king demanded o The general e or myself o 
You e said the little prince firmly o 
Exactly o One much require from each one the duty which each one can perform e the king went on o Accepted authority rests first of all on reason o If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea e they would rise up in revolution o I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable o 
Then my sunset o the little prince reminded him o for he never forgot a question once he had asked it o 
You shall have your sunset o I shall command it o But e according to my science of government e I shall wait until conditions are favourable o 
When will that be o inquired the little prince o 
Hum o Hum o replied the king; and before saying anything else he consulted a bulky almanac o Hum o Hum o That will be about o about o that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight o And you will see how well I am obeyed o 
The little prince yawned o He was regretting his lost sunset o And then e too e he was already beginning to be a little bored o 
I have nothing more to do here e he said to the king o So I shall set out on my way again o 
Do not go e said the king e who was very proud of having a subject o Do not go o I will make you a Minister o 
Minister of what o 
Minster of o of Justice o 
But there is nobody here to judge o 
We do not know that e the king said to him o I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom o I am very old o There is no room here for a carriage o And it tires me to walk o 
Oh e but I have looked already o said the little prince e turning around to give one more glance to the other side of the planet o On that side e as on this e there was nobody at all o 
Then you shall judge yourself e the king answered o that is the most difficult thing of all o It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others o If you succeed in judging yourself rightly e then you are indeed a man of true wisdom o 
Yes e said the little prince e but I can judge myself anywhere o I do not need to live on this planet o 
Hum o Hum o said the king o I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat o I hear him at night o You can judge this old rat o From time to time you will condemn him to death o Thus his life will depend on your justice o But you will pardon him on each occasion; for he must be treated thriftily o He is the only one we have o 
I e replied the little prince e do not like to condemn anyone to death o And now I think I will go on my way o 
No e said the king o 
But the little prince e having now completed his preparations for departure e had no wish to grieve the old monarch o 
If Your Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed e he said e he should be able to give me a reasonable order o He should be able e for example e to order me to be gone by the end of one minute o It seems to me that conditions are favourable o 
As the king made no answer e the little prince hesitated a moment o Then e with a sigh e he took his leave o 
I made you my Ambassador e the king called out e hastily o 
He had a magnificent air of authority o 
The grown-ups are very strange e the little prince said to himself e as he continued on his journey o Chapter XIThe second planet was inhabited by a conceited man o 
Ah o Ah o I am about to receive a visit from an admirer o he exclaimed from afar e when he first saw the little prince coming o 
For e to conceited men e all other men are admirers o 
Good morning e said the little prince o That is a queer hat you are wearing o 
It is a hat for salutes e the conceited man replied o It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me o Unfortunately e nobody at all ever passes this way o 
Yes o said the little prince e who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about o 
Clap your hands e one against the other e the conceited man now directed him o 
The little prince clapped his hands o The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute o 
This is more entertaining than the visit to the king e the little prince said to himself o And he began again to clap his hands e one against the other o The conceited man against raised his hat in salute o 
After five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the game's monotony o 
And what should one do to make the hat come down o he asked o 
But the conceited man did not hear him o Conceited people never hear anything but praise o 
Do you really admire me very much o he demanded of the little prince o 
What does that mean o 'admire' o 
To admire mean that you regard me as the handsomest e the best-dressed e the richest e and the most intelligent man on this planet o 
But you are the only man on your planet o 
Do me this kindness o Admire me just the same o 
I admire you e said the little prince e shrugging his shoulders slightly e but what is there in that to interest you so much o 
And the little prince went away o 
The grown-ups are certainly very odd e he said to himself e as he continued on his journey o Chapter XIIThe next planet was inhabited by a tippler o This was a very short visit e but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection o 
What are you doing there o he said to the tippler e whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles o 
I am drinking e replied the tippler e with a lugubrious air o 
Why are you drinking o demanded the little prince o 
So that I may forget e replied the tippler o 
Forget what o inquired the little prince e who already was sorry for him o 
Forget that I am ashamed e the tippler confessed e hanging his head o 
Ashamed of what o insisted the little prince e who wanted to help him o 
Ashamed of drinking o The tippler brought his speech to an end e and shut himself up in an impregnable silence o 
And the little prince went away e puzzled o 
The grown-ups are certainly very e very odd e he said to himself e as he continued on his journey o Chapter XIIIThe fourth planet belonged to a businessman o This man was so much occupied that he did not even raise his head at the little prince's arrival o 
Good morning e the little prince said to him o Your cigarette has gone out o 
Three and two make five o Five and seven make twelve o Twelve and three make fifteen o Good morning o Fifteen and seven make twenty-two o Twenty-two and six make twenty-eight o I haven't time to light it again o Twenty-six and five make thirty-one o Phew o Then that makes five-hundred-and-one-million e six-hundred-twenty-two-thousand e seven-hundred-thirty-one o Five hundred million what o asked the little prince o 
Eh o Are you still there o Five-hundred-and-one million o I can't stop o I have so much to do o I am concerned with matters of consequence o I don't amuse myself with balderdash o Two and five make seven o 
Five-hundred-and-one million what o repeated the little prince e who never in his life had let go of a question once he had asked it o 
The businessman raised his head o 
During the fifty-four years that I have inhabited this planet e I have been disturbed only three times o The first time was twenty-two years ago e when some giddy goose fell from goodness knows where o He made the most frightful noise that resounded all over the place e and I made four mistakes in my addition o The second time e eleven years ago e I was disturbed by an attack of rheumatism o I don't get enough exercise o I have no time for loafing o The third time o well e this is it o I was saying e then e five-hundred-and-one millions o 
Millions of what o 
The businessman suddenly realized that there was no hope of being left in peace until he answered this question o 
Millions of those little objects e he said e which one sometimes sees in the sky o 
Flies o 
Oh e no o Little glittering objects o 
Bees o 
Oh e no o Little golden objects that set lazy men to idle dreaming o As for me e I am concerned with matters of consequence o There is no time for idle dreaming in my life o 
Ah o You mean the stars o 
Yes e that's it o The stars o 
And what do you do with five-hundred millions of stars o 
Five-hundred-and-one million e six-hundred-twenty-two thousand e seven-hundred-thirty-one o I am concerned with matters of consequence o I am accurate o 
And what do you do with these stars o 
What do I do with them o 
Yes o 
Nothing o I own them o 
You own the stars o 
Yes o 
But I have already seen a king who o 
Kings do not own e they reign over o It is a very different matter o 

And what good does it do you to own the stars o 
It does me the good of making me rich o 
And what good does it do you to be rich o 
It makes it possible for me to buy more stars e if any are ever discovered o 
This man e the little prince said to himself e reasons a little like my poor tippler o 
Nevertheless e he still had some more questions o 
How is it possible for one to own the stars o 
To whom do they belong o the businessman retorted e peevishly o 
I don't know o To nobody o 
Then they belong to me e because I was the first person to think of it o 
Is that all that is necessary o 
Certainly o When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody e it is yours o When you discover an island that belongs to nobody e it is yours o When you get an idea before any one else e you take out a patent on it o it is yours o So with me o I own the stars e because nobody else before me ever thought of owning them o 
Yes e that is true e said the little prince o And what do you do with them o 
I administer them e replied the businessman o I count them and recount them o It is difficult o But I am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence o 
The little prince was still not satisfied o 
If I owned a silk scarf e he said e I could put it around my neck and take it away with me o If I owned a flower e I could pluck that flower and take it away with me o But you cannot pluck the stars from heaven o 
No o But I can put them in the bank o 
Whatever does that mean o 
That means that I write the number of my stars on a little paper o And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key o 
And that is all o 
That is enough e said the businessman o 
It is entertaining e thought the little prince o It is rather poetic o But it is of no great consequence o 
On matters of consequence e the little prince had ideas which were very different from those of the grown-ups o 
I myself own a flower e he continued his conversation with the businessman e which I water every day o I own three volcanoes e which I clean out every week (for I also clean out the one that is extinct; one never knows o It is of some use to my volcanoes e and it is of some use to my flower e that I own them o But you are of no use to the stars o 
The businessman opened his mouth e but he found nothing to say in answer o And the little prince went away o 
The grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary e he said simply e talking to himself as he continued on his journey o Chapter XIVThe fifth planet was very strange o It was the smallest of all o There was just enough room on it for a street lamp and a lamplighter o The little prince was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a lamplighter e somewhere in the heavens e on a planet e which had no people e and not one house o But he said to himself e nevertheless o 
It may well be that this man is absurd o But he is not so absurd as the king e the conceited man e the businessman e and the tippler o For at least his work has some meaning o When he lights his street lamp e it is as if he brought one more star to life e or one flower o When he puts out his lamp e he sends the flower e or the star e to sleep o That is a beautiful occupation o And since it is beautiful e it is truly useful o 
When he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter o Good morning o Why have you just put out your lamp o 
Those are the orders e replied the lamplighter o Good morning o 
What are the orders o 
The orders are that I put out my lamp o Good evening o 
And he lighted his lamp again o 
But why have you just lighted it again o 
Those are the orders e replied the lamplighter o 
I do not understand e said the little prince o 
There is nothing to understand e said the lamplighter o Orders are orders o Good morning o 
And he put out his lamp o 
Then he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares o 
I follow a terrible profession o In the old days it was reasonable o I put the lamp out in the morning e and in the evening I lighted it again o I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep o 
And the orders have been changed since that time o 
The orders have not been changed e said the lamplighter o That is the tragedy o From year to year the planet has turned more rapidly and the orders have not been changed o 
Then what o asked the little prince o 
Then o the planet now makes a complete turn every minute e and I no longer have a single second for repose o Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out o 
That is very funny o A day lasts only one minute e here where you live o 
It is not funny at all o said the lamplighter o While we have been talking together a month has gone by o 
A month o 
Yes e a month o Thirty minutes o Thirty days o Good evening o 
And he lighted his lamp again o 
As the little prince watched him e he felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders o He remembered the sunsets e which he himself had gone to seek e in other days e merely by pulling up his chair; and he wanted to help his friend o 
You know e he said e I can tell you a way you can rest whenever you want to o 
I always want to rest e said the lamplighter o 
For it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at the same time o The little prince went on with his explanation o 
Your planet is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it o To be always in the sunshine e you need only walk along rather slowly o When you want to rest e you will walk o and the day will last as long as you like o 
That doesn't do me much good e said the lamplighter o The one thing I love in life is to sleep o 
Then you're unlucky e said the little prince o 
I am unlucky e said the lamplighter o Good morning o And he put out his lamp o 
That man e said the little prince to himself e as he continued farther on his journey e that man would be scorned by all the others o by the king e by the conceited man e by the tippler e by the businessman o Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous o Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself o 
He breathed a sigh of regret e and said to himself e again o 
That man is the only one of them all whom I could have made my friend o But his planet is indeed too small o There is no room on it for two people o 
What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet e because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets o Chapter XVThe sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one o It was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote voluminous books o 
Oh e look o Here is an explorer o he exclaimed to himself when he saw the little prince coming o 
The little prince sat down on the table and panted a little o He had already travelled so much and so far o Where do you come from o the old gentleman said to him o 
What is that big book o said the little prince o What are you doing o 
I am a geographer e the old gentleman said to him o 
What is a geographer o asked the little prince o 
A geographer is a scholar who knows the location of all the seas e rivers e towns e mountains e and deserts o 
That is very interesting e said the little prince o Here at last is a man who has a real profession o And he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer o It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen o 
Your planet is very beautiful e he said o Has it any oceans o 
I couldn't tell you e said the geographer o 
Ah o The little prince was disappointed o Has it any mountains o 
I couldn't tell you e said the geographer o 
And towns e and rivers e and deserts o 
I couldn't tell you that e either o 
But you are a geographer o 
Exactly e the geographer said o But I am not an explorer o I haven't a single explorer on my planet o It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns e the rivers e the mountains e the seas e the oceans e and the deserts o The geographer is much too important to go loafing about o He does not leave his desk o But he receives the explorers in his study o He asks them questions e and he notes down what they recall of their travels o And if the recollections of any one among them seem interesting to him e the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer's moral character o 
Why is that o 
Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer o So would an explorer who drank too much o 
Why is that o asked the little prince o 
Because intoxicated men see double o Then the geographer would note down two mountains in a place where there was only one o 
I know some one e said the little prince e who would make a bad explorer o 
That is possible o Then e when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good e an inquiry is ordered into his discovery o 
One goes to see it o 
No o That would be too complicated o But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs o For example e if the discovery in question is that of a large mountain e one requires that large stones be brought back from it o 
The geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement o 
But you o you come from far away o You are an explorer o You shall describe your planet to me o 
And e having opened his big register e the geographer sharpened his pencil o The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil o One waits until the explorer has furnished proofs e before putting them down in ink o 
Well o said the geographer expectantly o 
Oh e where I live e said the little prince e it is not very interesting o It is all so small o I have three volcanoes o Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct o But one never knows o 
One never knows e said the geographer o 
I have also a flower o 
We do not record flowers e said the geographer o 
Why is that o The flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet o 
We do not record them e said the geographer e because they are ephemeral o 
What does that mean o 'ephemeral' o 
Geographies e said the geographer e are the books which e of all books e are most concerned with matters of consequence o They never become old-fashioned o It is very rarely that a mountain changes its position o It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters o We write of eternal things o 
But extinct volcanoes may come to life again e the little prince interrupted o What does that mean o 'ephemeral' o 
Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive e it comes to the same thing for us e said the geographer o The thing that matters to us is the mountain o It does not change o 
But what does that mean o 'ephemeral' o repeated the little prince e who never in his life had let go of a question e once he had asked it o 
It means e 'which is in danger of speedy disappearance o '
Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance o 
Certainly it is o 
My flower is ephemeral e the little prince said to himself e and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world o And I have left her on my planet e all alone o 
That was his first moment of regret o But he took courage once more o 
What place would you advise me to visit now o he asked o 
The planet Earth e replied the geographer o It has a good reputation o 
And the little prince went away e thinking of his flower o Chapter XVISo then the seventh planet was the Earth o 
The Earth is not just an ordinary planet o One can count; there are 111 kings (not forgetting e to be sure e the Negro kings among them e 7000 geographers e 900 e000 businessmen e 7 e500 e000 tipplers e and 311 e000 e000 conceited men o that is to say e about 2 e000 e000 e000 grown-ups o 
To give you an idea of the size of the Earth e I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain e over the whole of the six continents e a veritable army of 462 e511 lamplighters for the street lamps o 
Seen from a slight distance e that would make a splendid spectacle o The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera o First would come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia o Having set their lamps alight e these would go off to sleep o Next e the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps in the dance e and then they too would be waved back into the wings o After that would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies; then those of Africa and Europe e then those of South America; then those of South America; then those of North America o And never would they make a mistake in the order of their entry upon the stage o It would be magnificent o 
Only the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole e and his colleague who was responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole o only these two would live free from toil and care o they would be busy twice a year o Chapter XVIIWhen one wishes to play the wit e he sometimes wanders a little from the truth o I have not been altogether honest in what I have told you about the lamplighters o And I realize that I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not know it o Men occupy a very small place upon the Earth o If the two billion inhabitants who people its surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together e as they do for some big public assembly e they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide o All humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet o 
The grown-ups e to be sure e will not believe you when you tell them that o They imagine that they fill a great deal of space o They fancy themselves as important as the baobabs o You should advise them e then e to make their own calculations o They adore figures e and that will please them o But do not waste your time on this extra task o It is unnecessary o You have e I know e confidence in me o 
When the little prince arrived on the Earth e he was very much surprised not to see any people o He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet e when a coil of gold e the colour of the moonlight e flashed across the sand o Good evening e said the little prince courteously o 
Good evening e said the snake o 
What planet is this on which I have come down o asked the little prince o 
This is the Earth; this is Africa e the snake answered o 
Ah o Then there are no people on the Earth o 
This is the desert o There are no people in the desert o The Earth is large e said the snake o 
The little prince sat down on a stone e and raised his eyes toward the sky o 
I wonder e he said e whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again o Look at my planet o It is right there above us o But how far away it is o 
It is beautiful e the snake said o What has brought you here o 
I have been having some trouble with a flower e said the little prince o 
Ah o said the snake o 
And they were both silent o 
Where are the men o the little prince at last took up the conversation again o 
It is a little lonely in the desert o 
It is also lonely among men e the snake said o 
The little prince gazed at him for a long time o 
You are a funny animal e he said at last o You are no thicker than a finger o 
But I am more powerful than the finger of a king e said the snake o 
The little prince smiled o 
You are not very powerful o You haven't even any feet o You cannot even travel o 
I can carry you farther than any ship could take you e said the snake o 
He twined himself around the little prince's ankle e like a golden bracelet o 
Whomever I touch e I send back to the earth from whence he came e the snake spoke again o But you are innocent and true e and you come from a star o 
The little prince made no reply o 
You move me to pity o you are so weak on this Earth made of granite e the snake said o I can help you e some day e if you grow too homesick for your own planet o I can o 
Oh o I understand you very well e said the little prince o But why do you always speak in riddles o 
I solve them all e said the snake o 
And they were both silent o Chapter XVIIIThe little prince crossed the desert and met with only one flower o It was a flower with three petals e a flower of no account at all o Good morning e said the little prince o 
Good morning e said the flower o 
Where are the men o the little prince asked e politely o 
The flower had once seen a caravan passing o 
Men o she echoed o I think there are six or seven of them in existence o I saw them e several years ago o But one never knows where to find them o The wind blows them away o They have no roots e and that makes their life very difficult o 
Goodbye e said the little prince o 
Goodbye e said the flower o Chapter XIXAfter that e the little prince climbed a high mountain o The only mountains he had ever known were the three volcanoes e which came up to his knees o And he used the extinct volcano as a footstool o From a mountain as high as this one e he said to himself e I shall be able to see the whole planet at one glance e and all the people o 
But he saw nothing e save peaks of rock that were sharpened like needles o Good morning e he said courteously o 
Good morning o Good morning o Good morning e answered the echo o 
Who are you o said the little prince o 
Who are you o Who are you o Who are you o answered the echo o 
Be my friends o I am all alone e he said o 
I am all alone o all alone o all alone e answered the echo o 
What a queer planet o he thought o It is altogether dry e and altogether pointed e and altogether harsh and forbidding o And the people have no imagination o They repeat whatever one says to them o On my planet I had a flower; she always was the first to speak o Chapter XXBut it happened that after walking for a long time through sand e and rocks e and snow e the little prince at last came upon a road o 

And all roads lead to the abodes of men o 
Good morning e he said o 
He was standing before a garden e all a-bloom with roses o 
Good morning e said the roses o 
The little prince gazed at them o They all looked like his flower o Who are you o he demanded e thunderstruck o 
We are roses e the roses said o 
And he was overcome with sadness o His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe o And here were five thousand of them e all alike e in one single garden o 
She would be very much annoyed e he said to himself e if she should see that o she would cough most dreadfully e and she would pretend that she was dying e to avoid being laughed at o And I should be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life o for if I did not do that e to humble myself also e she would really allow herself to die o 
Then he went on with his reflections o I thought that I was rich e with a flower that was unique in all the world; and all I had was a common rose o A common rose e and three volcanoes that come up to my knees o and one of them perhaps extinct forever o that doesn't make me a very great prince o And he lay down in the grass and cried o Chapter XXIIt was then that the fox appeared o 
Good morning e said the fox o 
Good morning e the little prince responded politely e although when he turned around he saw nothing o 
I am right here e the voice said e under the apple tree o Who are you o asked the little prince e and added e You are very pretty to look at o 
I am a fox e said the fox o 
Come and play with me e proposed the little prince o I am so unhappy o 
I cannot play with you e the fox said o I am not tamed o 
Ah o Please excuse me e said the little prince o 
But e after some thought e he added o What does that mean o 'tame' o 
You do not live here e said the fox o What is it that you are looking for o 
I am looking for men e said the little prince o What does that mean o 'tame' o 
Men e said the fox o They have guns e and they hunt o It is very disturbing o They also raise chickens o These are their only interests o Are you looking for chickens o 
No e said the little prince o I am looking for friends o What does that mean o 'tame' o 
It is an act too often neglected e said the fox o It means to establish ties o 
'To establish ties' o 
Just that e said the fox o To me e you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys o And I have no need of you o And you e on your part e have no need of me o To you e I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes o But if you tame me e then we shall need each other o To me e you will be unique in all the world o To you e I shall be unique in all the world o 
I am beginning to understand e said the little prince o There is a flower o I think that she has tamed me o 
It is possible e said the fox o On the Earth one sees all sorts of things o 
Oh e but this is not on the Earth o said the little prince o 
The fox seemed perplexed e and very curious o 
On another planet o 
Yes o 
Are there hunters on this planet o 
No o 
Ah e that is interesting o Are there chickens o 
No o 
Nothing is perfect e sighed the fox o 
But he came back to his idea o 
My life is very monotonous e the fox said o I hunt chickens; men hunt me o All the chickens are just alike e and all the men are just alike o And e in consequence e I am a little bored o But if you tame me e it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life o I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others o Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground o Yours will call me e like music e out of my burrow o And then look o you see the grain-fields down yonder o I do not eat bread o Wheat is of no use to me o The wheat fields have nothing to say to me o And that is sad o But you have hair that is the colour of gold o Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me o The grain e which is also golden e will bring me back the thought of you o And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat o 
The fox gazed at the little prince e for a long time o 
Please o tame me o he said o 
I want to e very much e the little prince replied o But I have not much time o I have friends to discover e and a great many things to understand o 
One only understands the things that one tames e said the fox o Men have no more time to understand anything o They buy things all ready made at the shops o But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship e and so men have no friends any more o If you want a friend e tame me o 
What must I do e to tame you o asked the little prince o 
You must be very patient e replied the fox o First you will sit down at a little distance from me o like that o in the grass o I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye e and you will say nothing o Words are the source of misunderstandings o But you will sit a little closer to me e every day o 
The next day the little prince came back o 
It would have been better to come back at the same hour e said the fox o If e for example e you come at four o'clock in the afternoon e then at three o'clock I shall begin to be happy o I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances o At four o'clock e I shall already be worrying and jumping about o I shall show you how happy I am o But if you come at just any time e I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you o One must observe the proper rites o 
What is a rite o asked the little prince o 
Those also are actions too often neglected e said the fox o They are what make one day different from other days e one hour from other hours o There is a rite e for example e among my hunters o Every Thursday they dance with the village girls o So Thursday is a wonderful day for me o I can take a walk as far as the vineyards o But if the hunters danced at just any time e every day would be like every other day e and I should never have any vacation at all o So the little prince tamed the fox o And when the hour of his departure drew near o 
Ah e said the fox e I shall cry o 
It is your own fault e said the little prince o I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you o 
Yes e that is so e said the fox o 
But now you are going to cry o said the little prince o 
Yes e that is so e said the fox o 
Then it has done you no good at all o 
It has done me good e said the fox e because of the colour of the wheat fields o And then he added o 
Go and look again at the roses o You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world o Then come back to say goodbye to me e and I will make you a present of a secret o 
The little prince went away e to look again at the roses o 
You are not at all like my rose e he said o As yet you are nothing o No one has tamed you e and you have tamed no one o You are like my fox when I first knew him o He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes o But I have made him my friend e and now he is unique in all the world o 
And the roses were very much embarrassed o 
You are beautiful e but you are empty e he went on o One could not die for you o To be sure e an ordinary passer-by would think that my rose looked just like you o the rose that belongs to me o But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses o because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies; because it is she that I have listened to e when she grumbled e or boasted e or even sometimes when she said nothing o Because she is my rose o 
And he went back to meet the fox o 
Goodbye e he said o 
Goodbye e said the fox o And now here is my secret e a very simple secret o It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye o 
What is essential is invisible to the eye e the little prince repeated e so that he would be sure to remember o 
It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important o 
It is the time I have wasted for my rose o said the little prince e so that he would be sure to remember o 
Men have forgotten this truth e said the fox o But you must not forget it o You become responsible e forever e for what you have tamed o You are responsible for your rose o 
I am responsible for my rose e the little prince repeated e so that he would be sure to remember o Chapter XXIIGood morning e said the little prince o 
Good morning e said the railway switchman o 
What do you do here o the little prince asked o 
I sort out travellers e in bundles of a thousand e said the switchman o I send off the trains that carry them; now to the right e now to the left o 
And a brilliantly lighted express train shook the switchman's cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder o 
They are in a great hurry e said the little prince o What are they looking for o 
Not even the locomotive engineer knows that e said the switchman o 
And a second brilliantly lighted express thundered by e in the opposite direction o 
Are they coming back already o demanded the little prince o 
These are not the same ones e said the switchman o It is an exchange o 
Were they not satisfied where they were o asked the little prince o 
No one is ever satisfied where he is e said the switchman o 
And they heard the roaring thunder of a third brilliantly lighted express o 
Are they pursuing the first travellers o demanded the little prince o 
They are pursuing nothing at all e said the switchman o They are asleep in there e or if they are not asleep they are yawning o Only the children are flattening their noses against the windowpanes o 
Only the children know what they are looking for e said the little prince o They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them; and if anybody takes it away from them e they cry o 
They are lucky e the switchman said o Chapter XXIIIGood morning e said the little prince o 
Good morning e said the merchant o This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst o You need only swallow one pill a week e and you would feel no need of anything to drink o 
Why are you selling those o asked the little prince o 
Because they save a tremendous amount of time e said the merchant o Computations have been made by experts o With these pills e you save fifty-three minutes in every week o 
And what do I do with those fifty-three minutes o 
Anything you like o 
As for me e said the little prince to himself e if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked e I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water o Chapter XXIVIt was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert e and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water supply o 
Ah e I said to the little prince e these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I e too e should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water o 
My friend the fox o the little prince said to me o 
My dear little man e this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox o 
Why not o 
Because I am about to die of thirst o 
He did not follow my reasoning e and he answered me o 
It is a good thing to have had a friend e even if one is about to die o I e for instance e am very glad to have had a fox as a friend o 
He has no way of guessing the danger e I said to myself o He has never been either hungry or thirsty o A little sunshine is all he needs o 
But he looked at me steadily e and replied to my thought o 
I am thirsty e too o Let us look for a well o 
I made a gesture of weariness o It is absurd to look for a well e at random e in the immensity of the desert o But nevertheless we started walking o 
When we had trudged along for several hours e in silence e the darkness fell e and the stars began to come out o Thirst had made me a little feverish e and I looked at them as if I were in a dream o The little prince's last words came reeling back into my memory o 
Then you are thirsty e too o I demanded o 
But he did not reply to my question o He merely said to me o 
Water may also be good for the heart o 
I did not understand this answer e but I said nothing o I knew very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him o 
He was tired o He sat down o I sat down beside him o And e after a little silence e he spoke again o The stars are beautiful e because of a flower that cannot be seen o 
I replied e Yes e that is so o And e without saying anything more e I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in the moonlight o 
The desert is beautiful e the little prince added o 
And that was true o I have always loved the desert o One sits down on a desert sand dune e sees nothing e hears nothing o Yet through the silence something throbs e and gleams o 
What makes the desert beautiful e said the little prince e is that somewhere it hides a well o 
I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands o When I was a little boy I lived in an old house e and legend told us that a treasure was buried there o To be sure e no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it o But it cast an enchantment over that house o My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart o 
Yes e I said to the little prince o The house e the stars e the desert o what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible o 
I am glad e he said e that you agree with my fox o 
As the little prince dropped off to sleep e I took him in my arms and set out walking once more o I felt deeply moved e and stirred o It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure o It seemed to me e even e that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth o In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead e his closed eyes e his locks of hair that trembled in the wind e and I said to myself o What I see here is nothing but a shell o What is most important is invisible o 
As his lips opened slightly with the suspicious of a half-smile e I said to myself e again o What moves me so deeply e about this little prince who is sleeping here e is his loyalty to a flower o the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp e even when he is asleep o And I felt him to be more fragile still o I felt the need of protecting him e as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind o 
And e as I walked on so e I found the well e at daybreak o Chapter XXVMen e said the little prince e set out on their way in express trains e but they do not know what they are looking for o Then they rush about e and get excited e and turn round and round o 
And he added o It is not worth the trouble o 
The well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara o The wells of the Sahara are mere holes dug in the sand o This one was like a well in a village o But there was no village here e and I thought I must be dreaming o It is strange e I said to the little prince o Everything is ready for use o the pulley e the bucket e the rope o 
He laughed e touched the rope e and set the pulley to working o And the pulley moaned e like an old weathervane e which the wind has long since forgotten o 
Do you hear o said the little prince o We have wakened the well e and it is singing o 
I did not want him to tire himself with the rope o 
Leave it to me e I said o It is too heavy for you o 
I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it there o happy e tired as I was e over my achievement o The song of the pulley was still in my ears e and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water o 
I am thirsty for this water e said the little prince o Give me some of it to drink o 
And I understood what he had been looking for o 
I raised the bucket to his lips o He drank e his eyes closed o It was as sweet as some special festival treat o This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment o Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars e the song of the pulley e and the effort of my arms o It was good for the heart e like a present o When I was a little boy e the lights of the Christmas tree e the music of the Midnight Mass e the tenderness of smiling faces e used to make up e so e the radiance of the gifts I received o 
The men where you live e said the little prince e raise five thousand roses in the same garden o and they do not find in it what they are looking for o 
They do not find it e I replied o 
And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose e or in a little water o 
Yes e that is true e I said o 
And the little prince added o 
But the eyes are blind o One must look with the heart o 
I had drunk the water o I breathed easily o At sunrise the sand is the colour of honey o And that honey colour was making me happy e too o What brought me e then e this sense of grief o 
You must keep your promise e said the little prince e softly e as he sat down beside me once more o 
What promise o 
You know o a muzzle for my sheep o I am responsible for this flower o 
I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket o The little prince looked them over e and laughed as he said o 
Your baobabs o they look a little like cabbages o 
Oh o 
I had been so proud of my baobabs o 
Your fox o his ears look a little like horns; and they are too long o 
And he laughed again o 
You are not fair e little prince e I said o I don't know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside o 
Oh e that will be all right e he said e children understand o 
So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle o And as I gave it to him my heart was torn o 
You have plans that I do not know about e I said o 
But he did not answer me o He said to me e instead o 
You know o my descent to the earth o Tomorrow will be its anniversary o 
Then e after a silence e he went on o 
I came down very near here o 
And he flushed o 
And once again e without understanding why e I had a queer sense of sorrow o One question e however e occurred to me o 
Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you o a week ago o you were strolling along like that e all alone e a thousand miles from any inhabited region o You were on the your back to the place where you landed o 
The little prince flushed again o 
And I added e with some hesitancy o 
Perhaps it was because of the anniversary o 
The little prince flushed once more o He never answered questions o but when one flushes does that not mean Yes o 
Ah e I said to him e I am a little frightened o 
But he interrupted me o 
Now you must work o You must return to your engine o I will be waiting for you here o Come back tomorrow evening o 
But I was not reassured o I remembered the fox o One runs the risk of weeping a little e if one lets himself be tamed o Chapter XXVIBeside the well there was the ruin of an old stonewall o When I came back from my work e the next evening e I saw from some distance away my little price sitting on top of a wall e with his feet dangling o And I heard him say o 
Then you don't remember o This is not the exact spot o 
Another voice must have answered him e for he replied to it o 
Yes e yes o It is the right day e but this is not the place o 
I continued my walk toward the wall o At no time did I see or hear anyone o The little prince e however e replied once again o 
 o Exactly o You will see where my track begins e in the sand o You have nothing to do but wait for me there o I shall be there tonight o 
I was only twenty metres from the wall e and I still saw nothing o 
After a silence the little prince spoke again o 
You have good poison o You are sure that it will not make me suffer too long o 
I stopped in my tracks e my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand o 
Now go away e said the little prince o I want to get down from the wall o I dropped my eyes e then e to the foot of the wall o and I leaped into the air o There before me e facing the little prince e was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to an end o Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back o But e at the noise I made e the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain e and e in no apparent hurry e disappeared e with a light metallic sound e among the stones o 
I reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms; his face was white as snow o 
What does this mean o I demanded o Why are you talking with snakes o 
I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore o I had moistened his temples e and had given him some water to drink o And now I did not dare ask him any more questions o He looked at me very gravely e and put his arms around my neck o I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird e shot with someone's rifle o 
I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine e he said o Now you can go back home o 
How do you know about that o 
I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful e beyond anything that I had dared to hope o He made no answer to my question e but he added o I e too e am going back home today o 
Then e sadly o It is much farther o it is much more difficult o 
I realised clearly that something extraordinary was happening o I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him o 
His look was very serious e like some one lost far away o 
I have your sheep o And I have the sheep's box o And I have the muzzle o 
And he gave me a sad smile o 
I waited a long time o I could see that he was reviving little by little o 
Dear little man e I said to him e you are afraid o 
He was afraid e there was no doubt about that o But he laughed lightly o 
I shall be much more afraid this evening o 
Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable o And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more o For me e it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert o 
Little man e I said e I want to hear you laugh again o 
But he said to me o 
Tonight e it will be a year o my star e then e can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth e a year ago o 
Little man e I said e tell me that it is only a bad dream o this affair of the snake e and the meeting-place e and the star o 
But he did not answer my plea o He said to me e instead o 
The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen o 
Yes e I know o 
It is just as it is with the flower o If you love a flower that lives on a star e it is sweet to look at the sky at night o All the stars are a-bloom with flowers o 
Yes e I know o 
It is just as it is with the water o Because of the pulley e and the rope e what you gave me to drink was like music o You remember o how good it was o 
Yes e I know o 
And at night you will look up at the stars o Where I live everything is so small that I cannot show you where my star is to be found o It is better e like that o My star will just be one of the stars e for you o And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens o they will all be your friends o And e besides e I am going to make you a present o 
He laughed again o 
Ah e little prince e dear little prince o I love to hear that laughter o 
That is my present o Just that o It will be as it was when we drank the water o 
What are you trying to say o 
All men have the stars e he answered e but they are not the same things for different people o For some e who are travellers e the stars are guides o For others they are no more than little lights in the sky o For others e who are scholars e they are problems o For my businessman they were wealth o But all these stars are silent o You o you alone o will have the stars as no one else has them o 
What are you trying to say o 
In one of the stars I shall be living o In one of them I shall be laughing o And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing e when you look at the sky at night o you o only you o will have stars that can laugh o And he laughed again o 
And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows you will be content that you have known me o You will always be my friend o You will want to laugh with me o And you will sometimes open your window e so e for that pleasure o and your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky o Then you will say to them e 'Yes e the stars always make me laugh o ' And they will think you are crazy o It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you o 
And he laughed again o 
It will be as if e in place of the stars e I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh o 
And he laughed again o Then he quickly became serious o 
Tonight o you know o do not come e said the little prince o 
I shall not leave you e I said o 
I shall look as if I were suffering o I shall look a little as if I were dying o It is like that o Do not come to see that o It is not worth the trouble o 
I shall not leave you o 
But he was worried o 
I tell you o it is also because of the snake o He must not bite you o Snakes o they are malicious creatures o This one might bite you just for fun o 
I shall not leave you o 
But a thought came to reassure him o 
It is true that they have no more poison for a second bite o 
That night I did not see him set out on his way o He got away from me without making a sound o When I succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick and resolute step o He said to me merely o 
Ah o You are there o 
And he took me by the hand o But he was still worrying o 
It was wrong of you to come o You will suffer o I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be true o 
I said nothing o 
You understand o it is too far o I cannot carry this body with me o It is too heavy o 
I said nothing o 
But it will be like an old abandoned shell o There is nothing sad about old shells o 
I said nothing o 
He was a little discouraged o But he made one more effort o 
You know e it will be very nice o I e too e shall look at the stars o All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley o All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink o 
I said nothing o 
That will be so amusing o You will have five hundred million little bells e and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water o 
And he too said nothing more e because he was crying o 
Here it is o Let me go on by myself o And he sat down e because he was afraid o Then he said e again o 
You know o my flower o I am responsible for her o And she is so weak o She is so na?ve o She has four thorns e of no use at all e to protect herself against all the world o 
I too sat down e because I was not able to stand up any longer o 
There now o that is all o 
He still hesitated a little; then he got up o He took one step o I could not move o 
There was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle o He remained motionless for an instant o He did not cry out o He fell as gently as a tree falls o There was not even any sound e because of the sand o 
Chapter XXVII
And now six years have already gone by o 
I have never yet told this story o The companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive o I was sad e but I told them o I am tired o 
Now my sorrow is comforted a little o That is to say o not entirely o But I know that he did go back to his planet e because I did not find his body at daybreak o It was not such a heavy body o and at night I love to listen to the stars o It is like five hundred million little bells o 
But there is one extraordinary thing o when I drew the muzzle for the little prince e I forgot to add the leather strap to it o He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep o So now I keep wondering o what is happening on his planet o Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower o 
At one time I say to myself o Surely not o The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night e and he watches over his sheep very carefully o Then I am happy o And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars o 
But at another time I say to myself o At some moment or other one is absent-minded e and that is enough o On some one evening he forgot the glass globe e or the sheep got out e without making any noise e in the night o And then the little bells are changed to tears o 
Here e then e is a great mystery o For you who also love the little prince e and for me e nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere e we do not know where e a sheep that we never saw has o yes or no o o eaten a rose o 
Look up at the sky o Ask yourselves o is it yes or no o Has the sheep eaten the flower o And you will see how everything changes o 
And no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance o 
This is e to me e the loveliest and saddest landscape in the world o It is the same as that on the preceding page e but I have drawn it again to impress it on your memory o It is here that the little prince appeared on Earth e and disappeared o 
Look at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognise it in case you travel some day to the African desert o And e if you should come upon this spot e please do not hurry on o Wait for a time e exactly under the star o Then e if a little man appears who laughs e who has golden hair and who refuses to answer questions e you will know who he is o If this should happen e please comfort me o Send me word that he has come back o 
His friends called him Saint-Ex o In reality e he was named Antoine de Saint-Exup¨¦ry o He is one of the greatest French writers o He is also one of the pioneers of aviation o Here is his story o 
Saint-Exup¨¦ry was born in Lyon in 1900 o At an early age e he dreamt of adventure o His greatest ambition was to be an officer in the Navy o In order to become a Naval officer e one had to pass a very difficult exam o Saint-Exup¨¦ry took the exam and failed o there was e fortunately e another solution o aviation o At this time e aviation was extremely dangerous o Danger e risk o this is precisely for what Saint-Exup¨¦ry wished o During his military service e he learned to pilot airplanes o Saint-Exup¨¦ry had only one idea in his head o to fly o 
After his military service e he presented himself to the director of an airline company and expressed to him his desire to become a pilot o The director told him e Do like everyone else o First e you must become a mechanic o 
Saint-Exup¨¦ry worked to become a mechanic o In 1927 e he finally reached his goal o He was the pilot of a formation o He completed dangerous missions over the Mediterranean e over the Sahara o He had many accidents over the middle of the desert o Later e he was named the director of his own aviation company in South America o There also e he accomplished many dangerous missions over the Andes o 
For Saint-Exup¨¦ry e flying wasn't just piloting an airplane o It was also meditating e reflecting o During his missions e Saint-Exup¨¦ry thought deeply about solitude e friendship e the meaning of life e the human condition e and liberty o He published his reflections o His books had immediate success o 
Unfortunately e the aviation company for which Saint-Exup¨¦ry worked was having serious financial problems o Saint-Exup¨¦ry had to quit the company o He became a journalist o He went to Spain e Russia e and Germany o He flew when he could o 
In 1939 e France went to war with Germany o Saint-Exup¨¦ry enlisted immediately in the army o Defeat came soon o France was occupied by Hitler's troops o 
Saint-Exup¨¦ry didn't accept the defeat o He decided to leave France o He settled in the United States e where he continued to write o It was in New York that he published The Little Prince e one of his most celebrated books o 
In 1942 e American troops landed in North Africa o Saint-Exup¨¦ry decided to join the American army o At age 42 e he volunteered to be a pilot o He was told that he was too old o He persisted o Finally he obtained satisfaction o He was given an airplane o He accomplished many missions over occupied France o 

On the 31st of July e 1944 e Saint-Exup¨¦ry left for his last mission o His airplane was destroyed by Germans over the Mediterranean o On that day e Saint-Exup¨¦ry didn't return o in the open sky e he found risk e death e and glory o
