TRANSLATOR'S02PREFACE0202
A02few02words02about02Dostoevsky02himself02may02help02the02
English02reader02to02understand02his02work.0202
Dostoevsky02was02the02son02of02a02doctor.02His02parents02were02
very02hard\working02and02deeply02religious02people,02but02so02
poor02that02they02lived02with02their02five02children02in02only02two02
rooms.02The02father02and02mother02spent02their02evenings02in02
reading02aloud02to02their02children,02generally02from02books02of02a02
serious02character.0202
Though02always02sickly02and02delicate02Dostoevsky02came02
out02third02in02the02final02examination02of02the02Petersburg02school02
of02Engineering.02There02he02had02already02begun02his02first02work,02
"Poor02Folk."0202
This02story02was02published02by02the02poet02Nekrassov02in02his02
review02and02was02received02with02acclamations.02The02shy,02
unknown02youth02found02himself02instantly02something02of02a02
celebrity.02A02brilliant02and02successful02career02seemed02to02open02
before02him,02but02those02hopes02were02soon02dashed.02In02184902he02
was02arrested.0202
Though02neither02by02temperament02nor02conviction02a02
revolutionist,02Dostoevsky02was02one02of02a02little02group02of02
young02men02who02met02together02to02read02Fourier02and02
Proudhon.02He02was02accused02of02"taking02part02in02conversations02
against02the02censorship,02of02reading02a02letter02from02Byelinsky02
to02Gogol,02and02of02knowing02of02the02intention02to02set02up02a02
printing02press."02Under02Nicholas02I.02(that02"stern02and02just02
man,"02as02Maurice02Baring02calls02him)02this02was02enough,02and02
he02 was02 condemned02 to02 death.02 After02 eight02 months'02
imprisonment02he02was02with02twenty\one02others02taken02out02to02
the02Semyonovsky02Square02to02be02shot.02Writing02to02his02brother02
Mihail,02Dostoevsky02says:02"They02snapped02words02over02our02
heads,02and02they02made02us02put02on02the02white02shirts02worn02by02
persons02condemned02to02death.02Thereupon02we02were02bound02
in02threes02to02stakes,02to02suffer02execution.02Being02the02third02in02
the02row,02I02concluded02I02had02only02a02few02minutes02of02life02before02
me.02I02thought02of02you02and02your02dear02ones02and02I02contrived02to02
kiss02Plestcheiev02and02Dourov,02who02were02next02to02me,02and02to02
bid02them02farewell.02Suddenly02the02troops02beat02a02tattoo,02we02
were02unbound,02brought02back02upon02the02scaffold,02and02
informed02that02his02Majesty02had02spared02us02our02lives."02The02
sentence02was02commuted02to02hard02labour.0202
One02of02the02prisoners,02Grigoryev,02went02mad02as02soon02as02
he02was02untied,02and02never02regained02his02sanity.0202
The02intense02suffering02of02this02experience02left02a02lasting02
stamp02on02Dostoevsky's02mind.02Though02his02religious02temper02
led02him02in02the02end02to02accept02every02suffering02with02
resignation02and02to02regard02it02as02a02blessing02in02his02own02case,02
he02constantly02recurs02to02the02subject02in02his02writings.02He02
describes02the02awful02agony02of02the02condemned02man02and02
insists02on02the02cruelty02of02inflicting02such02torture.02Then02
followed02four02years02of02penal02servitude,02spent02in02the02
company02of02common02criminals02in02Siberia,02where02he02began02
the02"Dead02House,"02and02some02years02of02service02in02a02
disciplinary02battalion.0202
He02had02shown02signs02of02some02obscure02nervous02disease02
before02his02arrest02and02this02now02developed02into02violent02
attacks02of02epilepsy,02from02which02he02suffered02for02the02rest02of02
his02life.02The02fits02occurred02three02or02four02times02a02year02and02
were02more02frequent02in02periods02of02great02strain.02In02185902he02
was02allowed02to02return02to02Russia.02He02started02a02journal―
"Vremya,"02which02was02forbidden02by02the02Censorship02through02
a02misunderstanding.02In02186402he02lost02his02first02wife02and02his02
brother02Mihail.02He02was02in02terrible02poverty,02yet02he02took02
upon02himself02the02payment02of02his02brother's02debts.02He02
started02another02journal―"The02Epoch,"02which02within02a02few02
months02was02also02prohibited.02He02was02weighed02down02by02
debt,02his02brother's02family02was02dependent02on02him,02he02was02
forced02to02write02at02heart\breaking02speed,02and02is02said02never02
to02have02corrected02his02work.02The02later02years02of02his02life02were02
much02softened02by02the02tenderness02and02devotion02of02his02
second02wife.0202
In02June02188002he02made02his02famous02speech02at02the02
unveiling02of02the02monument02to02Pushkin02in02Moscow02and02he02
was02received02with02extraordinary02demonstrations02of02love02
and02honour.0202
A02few02months02later02Dostoevsky02died.02He02was02followed02
to02the02grave02by02a02vast02multitude02of02mourners,02who02"gave02
the02hapless02man02the02funeral02of02a02king."02He02is02still02probably02
the02most02widely02read02writer02in02Russia.0202
In02the02words02of02a02Russian02critic,02who02seeks02to02explain02
the02feeling02inspired02by02Dostoevsky:02"He02was02one02of02
ourselves,02a02man02of02our02blood02and02our02bone,02but02one02who02
has02suffered02and02has02seen02so02much02more02deeply02than02we02

the02heart02which02we02seek02that02we02may02learn02from02it02how02to02

CHAPTER02I0202
02
0202
On02an02exceptionally02hot02evening02early02in02July02a02young02
man02came02out02of02the02garret02in02which02he02lodged02in02S.02Place02
and02walked02slowly,02as02though02in02hesitation,02towards02K.02
bridge.0202He02had02successfully02avoided02meeting02his02landlady02on02
the02staircase.02His02garret02was02under02the02roof02of02a02high,02five\
storied02house02and02was02more02like02a02cupboard02than02a02room.02
The02landlady02who02provided02him02with02garret,02dinners,02and02
attendance,02lived02on02the02floor02below,02and02every02time02he02
went02out02he02was02obliged02to02pass02her02kitchen,02the02door02of02
which02invariably02stood02open.02And02each02time02he02passed,02the02
young02man02had02a02sick,02frightened02feeling,02which02made02him02
scowl02and02feel02ashamed.02He02was02hopelessly02in02debt02to02his02
landlady,02and02was02afraid02of02meeting02her.0202
This02was02not02because02he02was02cowardly02and02abject,02quite02
the02contrary;02but02for02some02time02past02he02had02been02in02an02
overstrained02irritable02condition,02verging02on02hypochondria.02
He02had02become02so02completely02absorbed02in02himself,02and02
isolated02from02his02fellows02that02he02dreaded02meeting,02not02only02
his02landlady,02but02anyone02at02all.02He02was02crushed02by02poverty,02
but02the02anxieties02of02his02position02had02of02late02ceased02to02weigh02
upon02him.02He02had02given02up02attending02to02matters02of02
practical02importance;02he02had02lost02all02desire02to02do02so.02
Nothing02that02any02landlady02could02do02had02a02real02terror02for02
him.02But02to02be02stopped02on02the02stairs,02to02be02forced02to02listen02
to02her02trivial,02irrelevant02gossip,02to02pestering02demands02for02
payment,02threats02and02complaints,02and02to02rack02his02brains02
for02excuses,02to02prevaricate,02to02lie―no,02rather02than02that,02he02
would02creep02down02the02stairs02like02a02cat02and02slip02out02unseen.0202
This02evening,02however,02on02coming02out02into02the02street,02
he02became02acutely02aware02of02his02fears.0202
"I02want02to02attempt02a02thing02 like02that02and02am02frightened02
by02these02trifles,"02he02thought,02with02an02odd02smile.02"Hm...02yes,02
all02is02in02a02man's02hands02and02he02lets02it02all02slip02from02
cowardice,02that's02an02axiom.02It02would02be02interesting02to02
know02what02it02is02men02are02most02afraid02of.02Taking02a02new02step,02
uttering02a02new02word02is02what02they02fear02most....02But02I02am02
talking02too02much.02It's02because02I02chatter02that02I02do02nothing.02
Or02perhaps02it02is02that02I02chatter02because02I02do02nothing.02I've02
learned02to02chatter02this02last02month,02lying02for02days02together02
in02my02den02thinking...02of02Jack02the02Giant\killer.02Why02am02I02
going02there02now?02Am02I02capable02of02that?02Is02that02serious?02It02is02
not02serious02at02all.02It's02simply02a02fantasy02to02amuse02myself;02a02
plaything!02Yes,02maybe02it02is02a02plaything."0202
The02heat02in02the02street02was02terrible:02and02the02airlessness,02
the02bustle02and02the02plaster,02scaffolding,02bricks,02and02dust02all02
about02him,02and02that02special02Petersburg02stench,02so02familiar02
to02all02who02are02unable02to02get02out02of02town02in02summer―all02
worked02 painfully02 upon02
the02 young02 man's02 already02
overwrought02nerves.02The02insufferable02stench02from02the02pot\
houses,02which02are02particularly02numerous02in02that02part02of02
the02town,02and02the02drunken02men02whom02he02met02continually,02
although02it02was02a02working02day,02completed02the02revolting02
misery02of02the02picture.02An02expression02of02the02profoundest02
disgust02gleamed02for02a02moment02in02the02young02man's02refined02
face.02He02was,02by02the02way,02exceptionally02handsome,02above02
the02average02in02height,02slim,02well\built,02with02beautiful02dark02
eyes02and02dark02brown02hair.02Soon02he02sank02into02deep02thought,02
or02more02accurately02speaking02into02a02complete02blankness02of02
mind;02he02walked02along02not02observing02what02was02about02him02
and02not02caring02to02observe02it.02From02time02to02time,02he02would02
mutter02something,02from02the02habit02of02talking02to02himself,02to02
which02he02had02just02confessed.02At02these02moments02he02would02
become02conscious02that02his02ideas02were02sometimes02in02a02
tangle02and02that02he02was02very02weak;02for02two02days02he02had02
scarcely02tasted02food.0202
He02was02so02badly02dressed02that02even02a02man02accustomed02
to02shabbiness02would02have02been02ashamed02to02be02seen02in02the02
street02in02such02rags.02In02that02quarter02of02the02town,02however,02
scarcely02any02shortcoming02in02dress02would02have02created02
surprise.02Owing02to02the02proximity02of02the02Hay02Market,02the02
number02 of02 establishments02 of02 bad02 character,02
the02
preponderance02 of02
trading02 and02 working02 class02
population02crowded02in02these02streets02and02alleys02in02the02heart02
of02Petersburg,02types02so02various02were02to02be02seen02in02the02
streets02that02no02figure,02however02queer,02would02have02caused02
surprise.02But02there02was02such02accumulated02bitterness02and02
the02
contempt02in02the02young02man's02heart,02that,02in02spite02of02all02the02
fastidiousness02of02youth,02he02minded02his02rags02least02of02all02in02
the02street.02It02was02a02different02matter02when02he02met02with02
acquaintances02or02with02former02fellow02students,02whom,02
indeed,02he02disliked02meeting02at02any02time.02And02yet02when02a02
drunken02man02who,02for02some02unknown02reason,02was02being02
taken02somewhere02in02a02huge02waggon02dragged02by02a02heavy02
dray02horse,02suddenly02shouted02at02him02as02he02drove02past:02
"Hey02there,02German02hatter"02bawling02at02the02top02of02his02voice02
and02pointing02at02him―the02young02man02stopped02suddenly02
and02clutched02tremulously02at02his02hat.02It02was02a02tall02round02hat02
from02Zimmerman's,02but02completely02worn02out,02rusty02with02
age,02all02torn02and02bespattered,02brimless02and02bent02on02one02
side02in02a02most02unseemly02fashion.02Not02shame,02however,02but02
quite02another02feeling02akin02to02terror02had02overtaken02him.0202
"I02knew02it,"02he02muttered02in02confusion,02"I02thought02so!02
That's02the02worst02of02all!02Why,02a02stupid02thing02like02this,02the02
most02trivial02detail02might02spoil02the02whole02plan.02Yes,02my02hat02
is02too02noticeable....02It02looks02absurd02and02that02makes02it02
noticeable....02With02my02rags02I02ought02to02wear02a02cap,02any02sort02
of02old02pancake,02but02not02this02grotesque02thing.02Nobody02wears02
such02a02hat,02it02would02be02noticed02a02mile02off,02it02would02be02
remembered....02 What02 matters02
is02 that02 people02 would02
remember02it,02and02that02would02give02them02a02clue.02For02this02
business02one02should02be02as02little02conspicuous02as02possible....02
Trifles,02trifles02are02what02matter!02Why,02it's02just02such02trifles02
that02always02ruin02everything...."0202
He02had02not02far02to02go;02he02knew02indeed02how02many02steps02it02
was02from02the02gate02of02his02lodging02house:02exactly02seven02
hundred02and02thirty.02He02had02counted02them02once02when02he02
had02been02lost02in02dreams.02At02the02time02he02had02put02no02faith02in02
those02dreams02and02was02only02tantalising02himself02by02their02
hideous02but02daring02recklessness.02Now,02a02month02later,02he02
had02begun02to02look02upon02them02differently,02and,02in02spite02of02
the02monologues02in02which02he02jeered02at02his02own02impotence02
and02indecision,02he02had02involuntarily02come02to02regard02this02
"hideous"02dream02as02an02exploit02to02be02attempted,02although02
he02still02did02not02realise02this02himself.02He02was02positively02going02
now02for02a02"rehearsal"02of02his02project,02and02at02every02step02his02
excitement02grew02more02and02more02violent.0202
With02a02sinking02heart02and02a02nervous02tremor,02he02went02up02
to02a02huge02house02which02on02one02side02looked02on02to02the02canal,02
and02on02the02other02into02the02street.02This02house02was02let02out02in02
tiny02tenements02and02was02inhabited02by02working02people02of02all02
kinds―tailors,02locksmiths,02cooks,02Germans02of02sorts,02girls02
picking02up02a02living02as02best02they02could,02petty02clerks,02etc.02
There02was02a02continual02coming02and02going02through02the02two02
gates02and02in02the02two02courtyards02of02the02house.02Three02or02four02
door\keepers02were02employed02on02the02building.02The02young02
man02was02very02glad02to02meet02none02of02them,02and02at02once02
slipped02unnoticed02through02the02door02on02the02right,02and02up02
the02staircase.02It02was02a02back02staircase,02dark02and02narrow,02but02
he02was02familiar02with02it02already,02and02knew02his02way,02and02he02
liked02all02these02surroundings:02in02such02darkness02even02the02
most02inquisitive02eyes02were02not02to02be02dreaded.0202
"If02I02am02so02scared02now,02what02would02it02be02if02it02somehow02
came02to02pass02that02I02were02really02going02to02do02it?"02he02could02
not02help02asking02himself02as02he02reached02the02fourth02storey.02
There02his02progress02was02barred02by02some02porters02who02were02
engaged02in02moving02furniture02out02of02a02flat.02He02knew02that02the02
flat02had02been02occupied02by02a02German02clerk02in02the02civil02
service,02and02his02family.02This02German02was02moving02out02then,02
and02so02the02fourth02floor02on02this02staircase02would02be02
untenanted02except02by02the02old02woman.02"That's02a02good02thing02
anyway,"02he02thought02to02himself,02as02he02rang02the02bell02of02the02
old02woman's02flat.02The02bell02gave02a02faint02tinkle02as02though02it02
were02made02of02tin02and02not02of02copper.02The02little02flats02in02such02
houses02always02have02bells02that02ring02like02that.02He02had02
forgotten02the02note02of02that02bell,02and02now02its02peculiar02tinkle02
seemed02to02remind02him02of02something02and02to02bring02it02clearly02
before02 him....02 He02 started,02 his02 nerves02 were02 terribly02
overstrained02by02now.02In02a02little02while,02the02door02was02opened02
a02tiny02crack:02the02old02woman02eyed02her02visitor02with02evident02
distrust02through02the02crack,02and02nothing02could02be02seen02but02
her02little02eyes,02glittering02in02the02darkness.02But,02seeing02a02
number02of02people02on02the02landing,02she02grew02bolder,02and02
opened02the02door02wide.02The02young02man02stepped02into02the02
dark02entry,02which02was02partitioned02off02from02the02tiny02
kitchen.02The02old02woman02stood02facing02him02in02silence02and02
looking02inquiringly02at02him.02She02was02a02diminutive,02withered02
up02old02woman02of02sixty,02with02sharp02malignant02eyes02and02a02
sharp02little02nose.02Her02colourless,02somewhat02grizzled02hair02
was02thickly02smeared02with02oil,02and02she02wore02no02kerchief02
over02it.02Round02her02thin02long02neck,02which02looked02like02a02
hen's02leg,02was02knotted02some02sort02of02flannel02rag,02and,02in02
spite02of02the02heat,02there02hung02flapping02on02her02shoulders,02a02
mangy02fur02cape,02yellow02with02age.02The02old02woman02coughed02
and02groaned02at02every02instant.02The02young02man02must02have02
looked02at02her02with02a02rather02peculiar02expression,02for02a02
gleam02of02mistrust02came02into02her02eyes02again.0202
"Raskolnikov,02a02student,02I02came02here02a02month02ago,"02the02
young02man02made02haste02to02mutter,02with02a02half02bow,02
remembering02that02he02ought02to02be02more02polite.0202
"I02remember,02my02good02sir,02I02remember02quite02well02your02
coming02here,"02the02old02woman02said02distinctly,02still02keeping02
her02inquiring02eyes02on02his02face.0202
"And02 here...02 I02 am02 again02 on02 the02 same02 errand,"02
Raskolnikov02continued,02a02little02disconcerted02and02surprised02
at02the02old02woman's02mistrust.02"Perhaps02she02is02always02like02
that02though,02only02I02did02not02notice02it02the02other02time,"02he02
thought02with02an02uneasy02feeling.0202
The02old02woman02paused,02as02though02hesitating;02then02
stepped02on02one02side,02and02pointing02to02the02door02of02the02room,02
she02said,02letting02her02visitor02pass02in02front02of02her:0202
"Step02in,02my02good02sir."0202
The02little02room02into02which02the02young02man02walked,02with02
yellow02paper02on02the02walls,02geraniums02and02muslin02curtains02
in02the02windows,02was02brightly02lighted02up02at02that02moment02by02
the02setting02sun.0202
"So02the02sun02will02shine02like02this02 then02too!"02flashed02as02it02
were02by02chance02through02Raskolnikov's02mind,02and02with02a02
rapid02glance02he02scanned02everything02in02the02room,02trying02as02
far02as02possible02to02notice02and02remember02its02arrangement.02
But02there02was02nothing02special02in02the02room.02The02furniture,02
all02very02old02and02of02yellow02wood,02consisted02of02a02sofa02with02a02
huge02bent02wooden02back,02an02oval02table02in02front02of02the02sofa,02a02
dressing\table02with02a02looking\glass02fixed02on02it02between02the02
windows,02chairs02along02the02walls02and02two02or02three02half\
penny02prints02in02yellow02frames,02representing02German02
damsels02with02birds02in02their02hands―that02was02all.02In02the02
corner02a02light02was02burning02before02a02small02ikon.02Everything02
was02very02clean;02the02floor02and02the02furniture02were02brightly02
polished;02everything02shone.0202
"Lizaveta's02work,"02thought02the02young02man.02There02was02
not02a02speck02of02dust02to02be02seen02in02the02whole02flat.0202
"It's02in02the02houses02of02spiteful02old02widows02that02one02finds02
such02cleanliness,"02Raskolnikov02thought02again,02and02he02stole02
a02curious02glance02at02the02cotton02curtain02over02the02door02
leading02into02another02tiny02room,02in02which02stood02the02old02
woman's02bed02and02chest02of02drawers02and02into02which02he02had02
never02looked02before.02These02two02rooms02made02up02the02whole02
flat.0202
"What02do02you02want?"02the02old02woman02said02severely,02
coming02into02the02room02and,02as02before,02standing02in02front02of02
him02so02as02to02look02him02straight02in02the02face.0202
"I've02brought02something02to02pawn02here,"02and02he02drew02
out02of02his02pocket02an02old\fashioned02flat02silver02watch,02on02the02
back02of02which02was02engraved02a02globe;02the02chain02was02of02
steel.0202"But02the02time02is02up02for02your02last02pledge.02The02month02was02
up02the02day02before02yesterday."0202
"I02will02bring02you02the02interest02for02another02month;02wait02a02
little."0202
"But02that's02for02me02to02do02as02I02please,02my02good02sir,02to02wait02
or02to02sell02your02pledge02at02once."0202
"How02much02will02you02give02me02for02the02watch,02Alyona02
Ivanovna?"0202
"You02come02with02such02trifles,02my02good02sir,02it's02scarcely02
worth02anything.02I02gave02you02two02roubles02last02time02for02your02
ring02and02one02could02buy02it02quite02new02at02a02jeweler's02for02a02
rouble02and02a02half."0202
"Give02me02four02roubles02for02it,02I02shall02redeem02it,02it02was02my02
father's.02I02shall02be02getting02some02money02soon."0202
"A02rouble02and02a02half,02and02interest02in02advance,02if02you02
like!"0202"A02rouble02and02a02half!"02cried02the02young02man.0202
"Please02yourself"―and02the02old02woman02handed02him02
back02the02watch.02The02young02man02took02it,02and02was02so02angry02
that02he02was02on02the02point02of02going02away;02but02checked02
himself02at02once,02remembering02that02there02was02nowhere02else02
he02could02go,02and02that02he02had02had02another02object02also02in02
coming.0202
"Hand02it02over,"02he02said02roughly.0202
The02old02woman02fumbled02in02her02pocket02for02her02keys,02and02
disappeared02behind02the02curtain02into02the02other02room.02The02
inquisitively,02
young02man,02left02standing02alone02in02the02middle02of02the02room,02
listened02
thinking.02 He02 could02 hear02 her02
unlocking02the02chest02of02drawers.0202
"It02must02be02the02top02drawer,"02he02reflected.02"So02she02
carries02the02keys02in02a02pocket02on02the02right.02All02in02one02bunch02
on02a02steel02ring....02And02there's02one02key02there,02three02times02as02
big02as02all02the02others,02with02deep02notches;02that02can't02be02the02
key02of02the02chest02of02drawers...02then02there02must02be02some02
other02chest02or02strong\box...02that's02worth02knowing.02Strong\
boxes02always02have02keys02like02that...02but02how02degrading02it02all02
is."0202The02old02woman02came02back.0202
"Here,02sir:02as02we02say02ten02copecks02the02rouble02a02month,02so02
I02must02take02fifteen02copecks02from02a02rouble02and02a02half02for02the02

before,02you02owe02me02now02twenty02copecks02on02the02same02
reckoning02in02advance.02That02makes02thirty\five02copecks02
altogether.02So02I02must02give02you02a02rouble02and02fifteen02copecks02
for02the02watch.02Here02it02is."0202
"What!02only02a02rouble02and02fifteen02copecks02now!"0202
"Just02so."0202
The02young02man02did02not02dispute02it02and02took02the02money.02
He02looked02at02the02old02woman,02and02was02in02no02hurry02to02get02
away,02as02though02there02was02still02something02he02wanted02to02
say02or02to02do,02but02he02did02not02himself02quite02know02what.0202
"I02may02be02bringing02you02something02else02in02a02day02or02two,02
Alyona02Ivanovna―a02valuable02thing―silver―a02cigarette\
box,02as02soon02as02I02get02it02back02from02a02friend..."02he02broke02off02in02
confusion.0202
"Well,02we02will02talk02about02it02then,02sir."0202
"Good\bye―are02you02always02at02home02alone,02your02sister02
is02not02here02with02you?"02He02asked02her02as02casually02as02possible02
as02he02went02out02into02the02passage.0202
"What02business02is02she02of02yours,02my02good02sir?"0202
"Oh,02nothing02particular,02I02simply02asked.02You02are02too02
quick....02Good\day,02Alyona02Ivanovna."0202
Raskolnikov02went02out02in02complete02confusion.02This02
confusion02became02more02and02more02intense.02As02he02went02
down02the02stairs,02he02even02stopped02short,02two02or02three02times,02
as02though02suddenly02struck02by02some02thought.02When02he02was02
in02the02street02he02cried02out,02"Oh,02God,02how02loathsome02it02all02is!02
and02can02I,02can02I02possibly....02No,02it's02nonsense,02it's02rubbish!"02
he02added02resolutely.02"And02how02could02such02an02atrocious02
thing02come02into02my02head?02What02filthy02things02my02heart02is02
capable02of.02Yes,02filthy02above02all,02disgusting,02loathsome,02
loathsome!―and02for02a02whole02month02I've02been...."02But02no02
words,02no02exclamations,02could02express02his02agitation.02The02
feeling02of02intense02repulsion,02which02had02begun02to02oppress02
and02torture02his02heart02while02he02was02on02his02way02to02the02old02
woman,02had02by02now02reached02such02a02pitch02and02had02taken02
such02a02definite02form02that02he02did02not02know02what02to02do02with02
himself02to02escape02from02his02wretchedness.02He02walked02along02
the02pavement02like02a02drunken02man,02regardless02of02the02
passers\by,02and02jostling02against02them,02and02only02came02to02his02
senses02when02he02was02in02the02next02street.02Looking02round,02he02
noticed02that02he02was02standing02close02to02a02tavern02which02was02
entered02by02steps02leading02from02the02pavement02to02the02
basement.02At02that02instant02two02drunken02men02came02out02at02
the02door,02and02abusing02and02supporting02one02another,02they02
mounted02
think,02
Raskolnikov02went02down02the02steps02at02once.02Till02that02
moment02he02had02never02been02into02a02tavern,02but02now02he02felt02
giddy02and02was02tormented02by02a02burning02thirst.02He02longed02
for02a02drink02of02cold02beer,02and02attributed02his02sudden02
weakness02to02the02want02of02food.02He02sat02down02at02a02sticky02little02
table02in02a02dark02and02dirty02corner;02ordered02some02beer,02and02
steps.02 Without02
stopping02
the02
to02
eagerly02drank02off02the02first02glassful.02At02once02he02felt02easier;02
and02his02thoughts02became02clear.0202
"All02that's02nonsense,"02he02said02hopefully,02"and02there02is02
nothing02in02it02all02to02worry02about!02It's02simply02physical02
derangement.02Just02a02glass02of02beer,02a02piece02of02dry02bread―
and02in02one02moment02the02brain02is02stronger,02the02mind02is02
clearer02and02the02will02is02firm!02Phew,02how02utterly02petty02it02all02
is!"0202But02in02spite02of02this02scornful02reflection,02he02was02by02now02
looking02cheerful02as02though02he02were02suddenly02set02free02from02
a02terrible02burden:02and02he02gazed02round02in02a02friendly02way02at02
the02people02in02the02room.02But02even02at02that02moment02he02had02a02
dim02foreboding02that02this02happier02frame02of02mind02was02also02
not02normal.0202
There02were02few02people02at02the02time02in02the02tavern.02
Besides02the02two02drunken02men02he02had02met02on02the02steps,02a02
group02consisting02of02about02five02men02and02a02girl02with02a02
concertina02had02gone02out02at02the02same02time.02Their02departure02
left02the02room02quiet02and02rather02empty.02The02persons02still02in02
the02tavern02were02a02man02who02appeared02to02be02an02artisan,02
drunk,02but02not02extremely02so,02sitting02before02a02pot02of02beer,02
and02his02companion,02a02huge,02stout02man02with02a02grey02beard,02in02
a02short02full\skirted02coat.02He02was02very02drunk:02and02had02
dropped02asleep02on02the02bench;02every02now02and02then,02he02
began02as02though02in02his02sleep,02cracking02his02fingers,02with02his02
arms02wide02apart02and02the02upper02part02of02his02body02bounding02
about02on02the02bench,02while02he02hummed02some02meaningless02
refrain,02trying02to02recall02some02such02lines02as02these:0202
"His02wife02a02year02he02fondly02loved02His02wife02a―a02year02he―
fondly02loved."0202
Or02suddenly02waking02up02again:0202
"Walking02along02the02crowded02row02He02met02the02one02he02
used02to02know."0202
CHAPTER02II0202
But02no02one02shared02his02enjoyment:02his02silent02companion02
looked02with02positive02hostility02and02mistrust02at02all02these02
manifestations.02There02was02another02man02in02the02room02who02
looked02somewhat02like02a02retired02government02clerk.02He02was02
sitting02apart,02now02and02then02sipping02from02his02pot02and02
looking02round02at02the02company.02He,02too,02appeared02to02be02in02
some02agitation.0202
02
0202
Raskolnikov02was02not02used02to02crowds,02and,02as02we02said02
before,02he02avoided02society02of02every02sort,02more02especially02of02
late.02But02now02all02at02once02he02felt02a02desire02to02be02with02other02
people.02Something02new02seemed02to02be02taking02place02within02
him,02and02with02it02he02felt02a02sort02of02thirst02for02company.02He02was02
so02 weary02 after02 a02 whole02 month02 of02 concentrated02
wretchedness02and02gloomy02excitement02that02he02longed02to02
rest,02if02only02for02a02moment,02in02some02other02world,02whatever02
it02might02be;02and,02in02spite02of02the02filthiness02of02the02
surroundings,02he02was02glad02now02to02stay02in02the02tavern.0202
The02master02of02the02establishment02was02in02another02room,02
but02he02frequently02came02down02some02steps02into02the02main02
room,02his02jaunty,02tarred02boots02with02red02turn\over02tops02
coming02into02view02each02time02before02the02rest02of02his02person.02
He02wore02a02full02coat02and02a02horribly02greasy02black02satin02
waistcoat,02with02no02cravat,02and02his02whole02face02seemed02
smeared02with02oil02like02an02iron02lock.02At02the02counter02stood02a02
boy02of02about02fourteen,02and02there02was02another02boy02
somewhat02younger02who02handed02whatever02was02wanted.02On02
the02counter02lay02some02sliced02cucumber,02some02pieces02of02
dried02black02bread,02and02some02fish,02chopped02up02small,02all02
smelling02very02bad.02It02was02insufferably02close,02and02so02heavy02
with02the02fumes02of02spirits02that02five02minutes02in02such02an02
atmosphere02might02well02make02a02man02drunk.0202
There02are02chance02meetings02with02strangers02that02interest02
us02from02the02first02moment,02before02a02word02is02spoken.02Such02
was02the02impression02made02on02Raskolnikov02by02the02person02
sitting02a02little02distance02from02him,02who02looked02like02a02retired02

afterwards,02and02even02ascribed02it02to02presentiment.02He02
looked02repeatedly02at02the02clerk,02partly02no02doubt02because02the02
latter02was02staring02persistently02at02him,02obviously02anxious02to02
enter02into02conversation.02At02the02other02persons02in02the02room,02
including02the02tavern\keeper,02the02clerk02looked02as02though02he02
were02used02to02their02company,02and02weary02of02it,02showing02a02
shade02of02condescending02contempt02for02them02as02persons02of02
station02and02culture02inferior02to02his02own,02with02whom02it02
would02be02useless02for02him02to02converse.02He02was02a02man02over02
fifty,02bald02and02grizzled,02of02medium02height,02and02stoutly02built.02
His02face,02bloated02from02continual02drinking,02was02of02a02yellow,02
even02greenish,02tinge,02with02swollen02eyelids02out02of02which02
keen02reddish02eyes02gleamed02like02little02chinks.02But02there02was02
something02very02strange02in02him;02there02was02a02light02in02his02
eyes02as02though02of02intense02feeling―perhaps02there02were02
even02thought02and02intelligence,02but02at02the02same02time02there02
was02a02gleam02of02something02like02madness.02He02was02wearing02

buttons02missing02except02one,02and02that02one02he02had02buttoned,02
evidently02clinging02to02this02last02trace02of02respectability.02A02
crumpled02shirt02front,02covered02with02spots02and02stains,02
protruded02from02his02canvas02waistcoat.02Like02a02clerk,02he02wore02

that02his02chin02looked02like02a02stiff02greyish02brush.02And02there02
was02something02respectable02and02like02an02official02about02his02
manner02too.02But02he02was02restless;02he02ruffled02up02his02hair02and02

dejectedly02resting02his02ragged02elbows02on02the02stained02and02
sticky02table.02At02last02he02looked02straight02at02Raskolnikov,02and02
said02loudly02and02resolutely:0202
"May02I02venture,02honoured02sir,02to02engage02you02in02polite02

"No,02 I02 am02 studying,"02 answered02 the02 young02 man,02
somewhat02surprised02at02the02grandiloquent02style02of02the02

"Just02what02I02thought!02I'm02a02man02of02experience,02immense02

beside02the02young02man,02facing02him02a02little02sideways.02He02was02

"No,02I02have02not02happened02to,"02answered02Raskolnikov.02
"What02do02you02mean?"0202
"Well,02I've02just02come02from02one02and02it's02the02fifth02night02

languid02interest.02The02boys02at02the02counter02fell02to02sniggering.02
The02
innkeeper02 came02 down02

They02went02in02from02the02yard02and02up02to02the02fourth02storey.02
The02staircase02got02darker02and02darker02as02they02went02up.02It02
was02nearly02eleven02o'clock02and02although02in02summer02in02
Petersburg02there02is02no02real02night,02yet02it02was02quite02dark02at02
the02top02of02the02stairs.0202
A02grimy02little02door02at02the02very02top02of02the02stairs02stood02
ajar.02A02very02poor\looking02room02about02ten02paces02long02was02
lighted02up02by02a02candle\end;02the02whole02of02it02was02visible02
from02the02entrance.02It02was02all02in02disorder,02littered02up02with02
rags02of02all02sorts,02especially02children's02garments.02Across02the02
furthest02corner02was02stretched02a02ragged02sheet.02Behind02it02
probably02was02the02bed.02There02was02nothing02in02the02room02
except02two02chairs02and02a02sofa02covered02with02American02
leather,02full02of02holes,02before02which02stood02an02old02deal02

iron02
in02 an02
table02 stood02 a02 smoldering02 tallow\candle02
candlestick.02It02appeared02that02the02family02had02a02room02to02
themselves,02not02part02of02a02room,02but02their02room02was02
practically02a02passage.02The02door02leading02to02the02other02rooms,02
or02rather02cupboards,02into02which02Amalia02Lippevechsel's02flat02
was02divided02stood02half02open,02and02there02was02shouting,02
uproar02and02laughter02within.02People02seemed02to02be02playing02
cards02 and02 drinking02 tea02 there.02 Words02 of02 the02 most02
unceremonious02kind02flew02out02from02time02to02time.0202
Raskolnikov02recognised02Katerina02Ivanovna02at02once.02She02
was02a02rather02tall,02slim02and02graceful02woman,02terribly02
emaciated,02with02magnificent02dark02brown02hair02and02with02a02
hectic02flush02in02her02cheeks.02She02was02pacing02up02and02down02in02
her02little02room,02pressing02her02hands02against02her02chest;02her02
lips02were02parched02and02her02breathing02came02in02nervous02
broken02gasps.02Her02eyes02glittered02as02in02fever02and02looked02
about02 with02 a02 harsh02
immovable02 stare.02 And02
that02
consumptive02and02excited02face02with02the02last02flickering02light02
of02the02candle\end02playing02upon02it02made02a02sickening02
impression.02She02seemed02to02Raskolnikov02about02thirty02years02
old02and02was02certainly02a02strange02wife02for02Marmeladov....02She02
had02not02heard02them02and02did02not02notice02them02coming02in.02
She02seemed02to02be02lost02in02thought,02hearing02and02seeing02
nothing.02The02room02was02close,02but02she02had02not02opened02the02
window;02a02stench02rose02from02the02staircase,02but02the02door02on02
to02the02stairs02was02not02closed.02From02the02inner02rooms02clouds02
of02tobacco02smoke02floated02in,02she02kept02coughing,02but02did02not02
close02the02door.02The02youngest02child,02a02girl02of02six,02was02asleep,02
sitting02curled02up02on02the02floor02with02her02head02on02the02sofa.02A02
boy02a02year02older02stood02crying02and02shaking02in02the02corner,02
probably02he02had02just02had02a02beating.02Beside02him02stood02a02girl02
of02nine02years02old,02tall02and02thin,02wearing02a02thin02and02ragged02
chemise02with02an02ancient02cashmere02pelisse02flung02over02her02
bare02shoulders,02long02outgrown02and02barely02reaching02her02
knees.02Her02arm,02as02thin02as02a02stick,02was02round02her02brother's02
neck.02 She02 was02 trying02 to02 comfort02 him,02 whispering02
something02to02him,02and02doing02all02she02could02to02keep02him02
from02whimpering02again.02At02the02same02time02her02large02dark02
eyes,02which02looked02larger02still02from02the02thinness02of02her02
frightened02face,02were02watching02her02mother02with02alarm.02
Marmeladov02did02not02enter02the02door,02but02dropped02on02his02
knees02in02the02very02doorway,02pushing02Raskolnikov02in02front02
of02him.02The02woman02seeing02a02stranger02stopped02indifferently02
facing02him,02coming02to02herself02for02a02moment02and02apparently02
wondering02what02he02had02come02for.02But02evidently02she02
decided02that02he02was02going02into02the02next02room,02as02he02had02to02
pass02through02hers02to02get02there.02Taking02no02further02notice02of02
him,02she02walked02towards02the02outer02door02to02close02it02and02
uttered02a02sudden02scream02on02seeing02her02husband02on02his02
knees02in02the02doorway.0202
"Ah!"02she02cried02out02in02a02frenzy,02"he02has02come02back!02The02
criminal!02the02monster!...02And02where02is02the02money?02What's02

different!02Where02are02your02clothes?02Where02is02the02money!02
Speak!"0202
And02
searching02 him.02 Marmeladov02
to02
fell02
submissively02and02obediently02held02up02both02arms02to02
facilitate02the02search.02Not02a02farthing02was02there.0202
"Where02is02the02money?"02she02cried―"Mercy02on02us,02can02he02
have02drunk02it02all?02There02were02twelve02silver02roubles02left02in02
the02chest!"02and02in02a02fury02she02seized02him02by02the02hair02and02
she02
dragged02him02into02the02room.02Marmeladov02seconded02her02
efforts02by02meekly02crawling02along02on02his02knees.0202
"And02this02is02a02consolation02to02me!02This02does02not02hurt02me,02

out,02shaken02to02and02fro02by02his02hair02and02even02once02striking02
the02ground02with02his02forehead.02The02child02asleep02on02the02floor02
woke02up,02and02began02to02cry.02The02boy02in02the02corner02losing02all02
control02began02trembling02and02screaming02and02rushed02to02his02
sister02in02violent02terror,02almost02in02a02fit.02The02eldest02girl02was02
shaking02like02a02leaf.0202
"He's02drunk02it!02he's02drunk02it02all,"02the02poor02woman02
screamed02in02despair―"and02his02clothes02are02gone!02And02they02
are02hungry,02hungry!"―and02wringing02her02hands02she02
pointed02to02the02children.02"Oh,02accursed02life!02And02you,02are02
you02not02ashamed?"―she02pounced02all02at02once02upon02
Raskolnikov―"from02the02tavern!02Have02you02been02drinking02
with02him?02You02have02been02drinking02with02him,02too!02Go02
away!"0202
The02young02man02was02hastening02away02without02uttering02a02

inquisitive02faces02were02peering02in02at02it.02Coarse02laughing02
faces02with02pipes02and02cigarettes02and02heads02wearing02caps02
thrust02themselves02in02at02the02doorway.02Further02in02could02be02
seen02figures02in02dressing02gowns02flung02open,02in02costumes02of02
unseemly02scantiness,02some02of02them02with02cards02in02their02
hands.02 They02 were02
diverted,02 when02
Marmeladov,02dragged02about02by02his02hair,02shouted02that02it02
was02a02consolation02to02him.02They02even02began02to02come02into02
the02room;02at02last02a02sinister02shrill02outcry02was02heard:02this02
came02from02Amalia02Lippevechsel02herself02pushing02her02way02
amongst02them02and02trying02to02restore02order02after02her02own02
fashion02and02for02the02hundredth02time02to02frighten02the02poor02
woman02by02ordering02her02with02coarse02abuse02to02clear02out02of02
particularly02
the02room02next02day.02As02he02went02out,02Raskolnikov02had02time02
to02put02his02hand02into02his02pocket,02to02snatch02up02the02coppers02he02
had02received02in02exchange02for02his02rouble02in02the02tavern02and02
to02lay02them02unnoticed02on02the02window.02Afterwards02on02the02
stairs,02he02changed02his02mind02and02would02have02gone02back.0202
"What02a02stupid02thing02I've02done,"02he02thought02to02himself,02
"they02have02Sonia02and02I02want02it02myself."02But02reflecting02that02
it02would02be02impossible02to02take02it02back02now02and02that02in02any02
case02he02would02not02have02taken02it,02he02dismissed02it02with02a02
wave02of02his02hand02and02went02back02to02his02lodging.02"Sonia02
wants02pomatum02too,"02he02said02as02he02walked02along02the02
street,02and02he02laughed02malignantly―"such02smartness02
costs02money....02Hm!02And02maybe02Sonia02herself02will02be02
bankrupt02to\day,02for02there02is02always02a02risk,02hunting02big02

He02sank02into02thought.0202
"And02what02if02I02am02wrong,"02he02cried02suddenly02after02a02
moment's02thought.02"What02if02man02is02not02really02a02scoundrel,02
man02in02general,02I02mean,02the02whole02race02of02mankind―then02

CHAPTER02III0202
He02waked02up02late02next02day02after02a02broken02sleep.02But02his02
sleep02had02not02refreshed02him;02he02waked02up02bilious,02
irritable,02ill\tempered,02and02looked02with02hatred02at02his02room.02
It02was02a02tiny02cupboard02of02a02room02about02six02paces02in02length.02
It02had02a02poverty\stricken02appearance02with02its02dusty02yellow02
paper02peeling02off02the02walls,02and02it02was02so02low\pitched02that02
a02man02of02more02than02average02height02was02ill02at02ease02in02it02and02
felt02every02moment02that02he02would02knock02his02head02against02
the02ceiling.02The02furniture02was02in02keeping02with02the02room:02
there02were02three02old02chairs,02rather02rickety;02a02painted02table02
in02the02corner02on02which02lay02a02few02manuscripts02and02books;02
the02dust02that02lay02thick02upon02them02showed02that02they02had02
been02long02untouched.02A02big02clumsy02sofa02occupied02almost02
the02whole02of02one02wall02and02half02the02floor02space02of02the02room;02
it02was02once02covered02with02chintz,02but02was02now02in02rags02and02
served02Raskolnikov02as02a02bed.02Often02he02went02to02sleep02on02it,02
as02he02was,02without02undressing,02without02sheets,02wrapped02in02
his02old02student's02overcoat,02with02his02head02on02one02little02
pillow,02under02which02he02heaped02up02all02the02linen02he02had,02
clean02and02dirty,02by02way02of02a02bolster.02A02little02table02stood02in02
front02of02the02sofa.0202
It02would02have02been02difficult02to02sink02to02a02lower02ebb02of02
disorder,02but02to02Raskolnikov02in02his02present02state02of02mind02
this02was02positively02agreeable.02He02had02got02completely02away02
from02everyone,02like02a02tortoise02in02its02shell,02and02even02the02
sight02of02a02servant02girl02who02had02to02wait02upon02him02and02
looked02sometimes02into02his02room02made02him02writhe02with02
nervous02irritation.02He02was02in02the02condition02that02overtakes02
some02monomaniacs02entirely02concentrated02upon02one02thing.02
His02landlady02had02for02the02last02fortnight02given02up02sending02
him02in02meals,02and02he02had02not02yet02thought02of02expostulating02
with02her,02though02he02went02without02his02dinner.02Nastasya,02the02
cook02and02only02servant,02was02rather02pleased02at02the02lodger's02
mood02and02had02entirely02given02up02sweeping02and02doing02his02
room,02only02once02a02week02or02so02she02would02stray02into02his02
room02with02a02broom.02She02waked02him02up02that02day.0202
"Get02up,02why02are02you02asleep?"02she02called02to02him.02"It's02
past02nine,02I02have02brought02you02some02tea;02will02you02have02a02
cup?02I02should02think02you're02fairly02starving?"0202
Raskolnikov02opened02his02eyes,02started02and02recognised02
Nastasya.0202
"From02the02landlady,02eh?"02he02asked,02slowly02and02with02a02
sickly02face02sitting02up02on02the02sofa.0202
"From02the02landlady,02indeed!"0202
She02set02before02him02her02own02cracked02teapot02full02of02weak02
and02stale02tea02and02laid02two02yellow02lumps02of02sugar02by02the02
side02of02it.0202
"Here,02Nastasya,02take02it02please,"02he02said,02fumbling02in02his02
pocket02(for02he02had02slept02in02his02clothes)02and02taking02out02a02
handful02of02coppers―"run02and02buy02me02a02loaf.02And02get02me02a02
little02sausage,02the02cheapest,02at02the02pork\butcher's."0202
"The02loaf02I'll02fetch02you02this02very02minute,02but02wouldn't02
you02rather02have02some02cabbage02soup02instead02of02sausage?02
It's02capital02soup,02yesterday's.02I02saved02it02for02you02yesterday,02
but02you02came02in02late.02It's02fine02soup."0202
When02the02soup02had02been02brought,02and02he02had02begun02
upon02it,02Nastasya02sat02down02beside02him02on02the02sofa02and02
began02chatting.02She02was02a02country02peasant\woman02and02a02
very02talkative02one.0202
"Praskovya02Pavlovna02means02to02complain02to02the02police02
about02you,"02she02said.0202
He02scowled.0202
"To02the02police?02What02does02she02want?"0202
"You02don't02pay02her02money02and02you02won't02turn02out02of02the02
room.02That's02what02she02wants,02to02be02sure."0202
"The02devil,02that's02the02last02straw,"02he02muttered,02grinding02
his02teeth,02"no,02that02would02not02suit02me...02just02now.02She02is02a02
fool,"02he02added02aloud.02"I'll02go02and02talk02to02her02to\day."0202
"Fool02she02is02and02no02mistake,02just02as02I02am.02But02why,02if02you02
are02so02clever,02do02you02lie02here02like02a02sack02and02have02nothing02
to02show02for02it?02One02time02you02used02to02go02out,02you02say,02to02
teach02children.02But02why02is02it02you02do02nothing02now?"0202
"I02 am02 doing..."02 Raskolnikov02 began02 sullenly02 and02
reluctantly.0202
"What02are02you02doing?"0202
"Work..."0202
"What02sort02of02work?"0202
"I02am02thinking,"02he02answered02seriously02after02a02pause.0202
Nastasya02was02overcome02with02a02fit02of02laughter.02She02was02
given02to02laughter02and02when02anything02amused02her,02she02
laughed02inaudibly,02quivering02and02shaking02all02over02till02she02
felt02ill.0202
"And02have02you02made02much02money02by02your02thinking?"02
she02managed02to02articulate02at02last.0202
"One02can't02go02out02to02give02lessons02without02boots.02And02I'm02
sick02of02it."0202
"Don't02quarrel02with02your02bread02and02butter."0202
"They02pay02so02little02for02lessons.02What's02the02use02of02a02few02
coppers?"02he02answered,02reluctantly,02as02though02replying02to02
his02own02thought.0202
"And02you02want02to02get02a02fortune02all02at02once?"0202
He02looked02at02her02strangely.0202
"Yes,02I02want02a02fortune,"02he02answered02firmly,02after02a02brief02
pause.0202
"Don't02be02in02such02a02hurry,02you02quite02frighten02me!02Shall02I02
get02you02the02loaf02or02not?"0202
"As02you02please."0202
"Ah,02I02forgot!02A02letter02came02for02you02yesterday02when02you02
were02out."0202
"A02letter?02for02me!02from02whom?"0202
"I02can't02say.02I02gave02three02copecks02of02my02own02to02the02
postman02for02it.02Will02you02pay02me02back?"0202
"Then02bring02it02to02me,02for02God's02sake,02bring02it,"02cried02
Raskolnikov02greatly02excited―"good02God!"0202
A02minute02later02the02letter02was02brought02him.02That02was02it:02
from02his02mother,02from02the02province02of02R――.02He02turned02
pale02when02he02took02it.02It02was02a02long02while02since02he02had02
received02a02letter,02but02another02feeling02also02suddenly02
stabbed02his02heart.0202
"Nastasya,02leave02me02alone,02for02goodness'02sake;02here02are02
your02three02copecks,02but02for02goodness'02sake,02make02haste02
and02go!"0202
The02letter02was02quivering02in02his02hand;02he02did02not02want02to02
open02it02in02her02presence;02he02wanted02to02be02left02 alone02with02
this02letter.02When02Nastasya02had02gone02out,02he02lifted02it02quickly02
to02his02lips02and02kissed02it;02then02he02gazed02intently02at02the02
address,02the02small,02sloping02handwriting,02so02dear02and02
familiar,02of02the02mother02who02had02once02taught02him02to02read02
and02write.02He02delayed;02he02seemed02almost02afraid02of02
something.02At02last02he02opened02it;02it02was02a02thick02heavy02letter,02
weighing02over02two02ounces,02two02large02sheets02of02note02paper02
were02covered02with02very02small02handwriting.0202
"My02dear02Rodya,"02wrote02his02mother―"it's02two02months02
since02I02last02had02a02talk02with02you02by02letter02which02has02

Svidrigra07lovs'02house,02when02you02wrote02that02and02asked02me02

do?02And,02besides,02I02did02not02know02the02whole02truth02myself02
then.02What02made02it02all02so02difficult02was02that02Dounia02
received02a02hundred02roubles02in02advance02when02she02took02the02
place02as02governess02in02their02family,02on02condition02of02part02of02

money02came02from02Dounia's02savings,02but02that02was02not02so,02
and02now02I02tell02you02all02about02it,02because,02thank02God,02things02
have02suddenly02changed02for02the02better,02and02that02you02may02
know02how02Dounia02loves02you02and02what02a02heart02she02has.02At02
first02indeed02Mr.02Svidriga07lov02treated02her02very02rudely02and02

Petrovna,02Mr.02Svidriga07lov's02wife,02and02all02the02rest02of02the02

Mr.02Svidriga07lov,02relapsing02into02his02old02regimental02habits,02

it02was02all02explained02later02on?02Would02you02believe02that02the02
crazy02fellow02had02conceived02a02passion02for02Dounia02from02the02
beginning,02but02had02concealed02it02under02a02show02of02rudeness02
and02contempt.02Possibly02he02was02ashamed02and02horrified02
himself02at02his02own02flighty02hopes,02considering02his02years02and02
his02being02the02father02of02a02family;02and02that02made02him02angry02
with02Dounia.02And02possibly,02too,02he02hoped02by02his02rude02and02
sneering02behaviour02to02hide02the02truth02from02others.02But02at02
last02he02lost02all02control02and02had02the02face02to02make02Dounia02an02
open02and02shameful02proposal,02promising02her02all02sorts02of02
inducements02and02offering,02besides,02to02throw02up02everything02
and02take02her02to02another02estate02of02his,02or02even02abroad.02You02
can02imagine02all02she02went02through!02To02leave02her02situation02at02
once02was02impossible02not02only02on02account02of02the02money02
debt,02but02also02to02spare02the02feelings02of02Marfa02Petrovna,02
whose02suspicions02would02have02been02aroused:02and02then02
Dounia02would02have02been02the02cause02of02a02rupture02in02the02
family.02And02it02would02have02meant02a02terrible02scandal02for02
Dounia02too;02that02would02have02been02inevitable.02There02were02
various02other02reasons02owing02to02which02Dounia02could02not02
hope02to02escape02from02that02awful02house02for02another02six02
weeks.02You02know02Dounia,02of02course;02you02know02how02clever02
she02is02and02what02a02strong02will02she02has.02Dounia02can02endure02a02
great02deal02and02even02in02the02most02difficult02cases02she02has02the02
fortitude02to02maintain02her02firmness.02She02did02not02even02write02
to02me02about02everything02for02fear02of02upsetting02me,02although02
we02were02constantly02in02communication.02It02all02ended02very02
unexpectedly.02Marfa02Petrovna02accidentally02overheard02her02
husband02imploring02Dounia02in02the02garden,02and,02putting02
quite02a02wrong02interpretation02on02the02position,02threw02the02
blame02upon02her,02believing02her02to02be02the02cause02of02it02all.02An02
awful02scene02took02place02between02them02on02the02spot02in02the02
garden;02Marfa02Petrovna02went02so02far02as02to02strike02Dounia,02
refused02to02hear02anything02and02was02shouting02at02her02for02a02
whole02hour02and02then02gave02orders02that02Dounia02should02be02
packed02off02at02once02to02me02in02a02plain02peasant's02cart,02into02
which02they02flung02all02her02things,02her02linen02and02her02clothes,02
all02pell\mell,02without02folding02it02up02and02packing02it.02And02a02
heavy02shower02of02rain02came02on,02too,02and02Dounia,02insulted02
and02put02to02shame,02had02to02drive02with02a02peasant02in02an02open02
cart02all02the02seventeen02versts02into02town.02Only02think02now02
what02answer02could02I02have02sent02to02the02letter02I02received02from02
you02two02months02ago02and02what02could02I02have02written?02I02was02
in02despair;02I02dared02not02write02to02you02the02truth02because02you02
would02have02been02very02unhappy,02mortified02and02indignant,02
and02yet02what02could02you02do?02You02could02only02perhaps02ruin02
yourself,02and,02besides,02Dounia02would02not02allow02it;02and02fill02
up02my02letter02with02trifles02when02my02heart02was02so02full02of02
sorrow,02I02could02not.02For02a02whole02month02the02town02was02full02
of02gossip02about02this02scandal,02and02it02came02to02such02a02pass02
that02Dounia02and02I02dared02not02even02go02to02church02on02account02
of02the02contemptuous02looks,02whispers,02and02even02remarks02
made02aloud02about02us.02All02our02acquaintances02avoided02us,02
nobody02even02bowed02to02us02in02the02street,02and02I02learnt02that02
some02shopmen02and02clerks02were02intending02to02insult02us02in02a02
shameful02way,02smearing02the02gates02of02our02house02with02pitch,02
so02that02the02landlord02began02to02tell02us02we02must02leave.02All02this02
was02set02going02by02Marfa02Petrovna02who02managed02to02slander02
Dounia02and02throw02dirt02at02her02in02every02family.02She02knows02
everyone02in02the02neighbourhood,02and02that02month02she02was02
continually02coming02into02the02town,02and02as02she02is02rather02
talkative02and02fond02of02gossiping02about02her02family02affairs02and02
particularly02of02complaining02to02all02and02each02of02her02
husband―which02is02not02at02all02right―so02in02a02short02time02she02
had02spread02her02story02not02only02in02the02town,02but02over02the02
whole02surrounding02district.02It02made02me02ill,02but02Dounia02
bore02it02better02than02I02did,02and02if02only02you02could02have02seen02
how02she02endured02it02all02and02tried02to02comfort02me02and02cheer02
me02up!02She02is02an02angel!02But02by02God's02mercy,02our02sufferings02
were02cut02short:02Mr.02Svidriga07lov02returned02to02his02senses02and02
repented02and,02probably02feeling02sorry02for02Dounia,02he02laid02
before02Marfa02Petrovna02a02complete02and02unmistakable02proof02
of02Dounia's02innocence,02in02the02form02of02a02letter02Dounia02had02
been02forced02to02write02and02give02to02him,02before02Marfa02
Petrovna02came02upon02them02in02the02garden.02This02letter,02which02
remained02in02Mr.02Svidriga07lov's02hands02after02her02departure,02
she02had02written02to02refuse02personal02explanations02and02secret02
interviews,02for02which02he02was02entreating02her.02In02that02letter02
she02reproached02him02with02great02heat02and02indignation02for02
the02baseness02of02his02behaviour02in02regard02to02Marfa02Petrovna,02
reminding02him02that02he02was02the02father02and02head02of02a02family02
and02telling02him02how02infamous02it02was02of02him02to02torment02and02
make02 unhappy02 a02 defenceless02 girl,02 unhappy02 enough02
already.02Indeed,02dear02Rodya,02the02letter02was02so02nobly02and02
touchingly02written02that02I02sobbed02when02I02read02it02and02to02this02
day02I02cannot02read02it02without02tears.02Moreover,02the02evidence02
of02the02servants,02too,02cleared02Dounia's02reputation;02they02had02
seen02and02known02a02great02deal02more02than02Mr.02Svidriga07lov02
had02himself02supposed―as02indeed02is02always02the02case02with02
servants.02Marfa02Petrovna02was02completely02taken02aback,02and02
'again02crushed'02as02she02said02herself02to02us,02but02she02was02
completely02convinced02of02Dounia's02innocence.02The02very02
next02day,02being02Sunday,02she02went02straight02to02the02Cathedral,02
knelt02down02and02prayed02with02tears02to02Our02Lady02to02give02her02
strength02to02bear02this02new02trial02and02to02do02her02duty.02Then02
she02came02straight02from02the02Cathedral02to02us,02told02us02the02
whole02 story,02 wept02 bitterly02 and,02 fully02 penitent,02 she02
embraced02Dounia02and02besought02her02to02forgive02her.02The02
same02morning02without02any02delay,02she02went02round02to02all02the02
houses02in02the02town02and02everywhere,02shedding02tears,02she02
asserted02in02the02most02flattering02terms02Dounia's02innocence02
and02the02nobility02of02her02feelings02and02her02behavior.02What02
was02more,02she02showed02and02read02to02everyone02the02letter02in02
Dounia's02own02handwriting02to02Mr.02Svidriga07lov02and02even02
allowed02them02to02take02copies02of02it―which02I02must02say02I02think02
was02superfluous.02In02this02way02she02was02busy02for02several02days02
in02driving02about02the02whole02town,02because02some02people02had02
taken02offence02through02precedence02having02been02given02to02
others.02And02therefore02they02had02to02take02turns,02so02that02in02
every02house02she02was02expected02before02she02arrived,02and02
everyone02knew02that02on02such02and02such02a02day02Marfa02
Petrovna02would02be02reading02the02letter02in02such02and02such02a02
place02and02people02assembled02for02every02reading02of02it,02even02
many02who02had02heard02it02several02times02already02both02in02their02
own02houses02and02in02other02people's.02In02my02opinion02a02great02
deal,02a02very02great02deal02of02all02this02was02unnecessary;02but02
that's02Marfa02Petrovna's02character.02Anyway02she02succeeded02
in02completely02re\establishing02Dounia's02reputation02and02the02
whole02ignominy02of02this02affair02rested02as02an02indelible02
disgrace02upon02her02husband,02as02the02only02person02to02blame,02
so02that02I02really02began02to02feel02sorry02for02him;02it02was02really02
treating02the02crazy02fellow02too02harshly.02Dounia02was02at02once02
asked02to02give02lessons02in02several02families,02but02she02refused.02
All02of02a02sudden02everyone02began02to02treat02her02with02marked02
respect02and02all02this02did02much02to02bring02about02the02event02by02
which,02 one02 may02 say,02 our02 whole02 fortunes02 are02 now02
transformed.02You02must02know,02dear02Rodya,02that02Dounia02has02
a02suitor02and02that02she02has02already02consented02to02marry02him.02I02
hasten02to02tell02you02all02about02the02matter,02and02though02it02has02
been02arranged02without02asking02your02consent,02I02think02you02
will02not02be02aggrieved02with02me02or02with02your02sister02on02that02
account,02for02you02will02see02that02we02could02not02wait02and02put02off02
our02decision02till02we02heard02from02you.02And02you02could02not02
have02judged02all02the02facts02without02being02on02the02spot.02This02
was02how02it02happened.02He02is02already02of02the02rank02of02a02
counsellor,02Pyotr02Petrovitch02Luzhin,02and02is02distantly02
related02to02Marfa02Petrovna,02who02has02been02very02active02in02
bringing02the02match02about.02It02began02with02his02expressing02
through02her02his02desire02to02make02our02acquaintance.02He02was02
properly02received,02drank02coffee02with02us02and02the02very02next02
day02he02sent02us02a02letter02in02which02he02very02courteously02made02
an02offer02and02begged02for02a02speedy02and02decided02answer.02He02
is02a02very02busy02man02and02is02in02a02great02hurry02to02get02to02
Petersburg,02so02that02every02moment02is02precious02to02him.02At02
first,02of02course,02we02were02greatly02surprised,02as02it02had02all02
happened02so02quickly02and02unexpectedly.02We02thought02and02
talked02it02over02the02whole02day.02He02is02a02well\to\do02man,02to02be02
depended02upon,02he02has02two02posts02in02the02government02and02
has02already02made02his02fortune.02It02is02true02that02he02is02forty\five02
years02old,02but02he02is02of02a02fairly02prepossessing02appearance02
and02might02still02be02thought02attractive02by02women,02and02he02is02
altogether02a02very02respectable02and02presentable02man,02only02
he02seems02a02little02morose02and02somewhat02conceited.02But02
possibly02that02may02only02be02the02impression02he02makes02at02first02
sight.02And02beware,02dear02Rodya,02when02he02comes02to02
Petersburg,02as02he02shortly02will02do,02beware02of02judging02him02
too02hastily02and02severely,02as02your02way02is,02if02there02is02anything02
you02do02not02like02in02him02at02first02sight.02I02give02you02this02warning,02
although02I02feel02sure02that02he02will02make02a02favourable02
impression02upon02you.02Moreover,02in02order02to02understand02
any02man02one02must02be02deliberate02and02careful02to02avoid02
forming02prejudices02and02mistaken02ideas,02which02are02very02
difficult02to02correct02and02get02over02afterwards.02And02Pyotr02
Petrovitch,02judging02by02many02indications,02is02a02thoroughly02
estimable02man.02At02his02first02visit,02indeed,02he02told02us02that02he02
was02a02practical02man,02but02still02he02shares,02as02he02expressed02it,02
many02of02the02convictions02'of02our02most02rising02generation'02
and02he02is02an02opponent02of02all02prejudices.02He02said02a02good02deal02
more,02for02he02seems02a02little02conceited02and02likes02to02be02
listened02to,02but02this02is02scarcely02a02vice.02I,02of02course,02
understood02very02little02of02it,02but02Dounia02explained02to02me02
that,02though02he02is02not02a02man02of02great02education,02he02is02clever02
and02seems02to02be02good\natured.02You02know02your02sister's02
character,02Rodya.02She02is02a02resolute,02sensible,02patient02and02
generous02girl,02but02she02has02a02passionate02heart,02as02I02know02
very02well.02Of02course,02there02is02no02great02love02either02on02his02
side,02or02on02hers,02but02Dounia02is02a02clever02girl02and02has02the02
heart02of02an02angel,02and02will02make02it02her02duty02to02make02her02
husband02happy02who02on02his02side02will02make02her02happiness02
his02care.02Of02that02we02have02no02good02reason02to02doubt,02though02
it02must02be02admitted02the02matter02has02been02arranged02in02great02
haste.02Besides02he02is02a02man02of02great02prudence02and02he02will02
see,02to02be02sure,02of02himself,02that02his02own02happiness02will02be02
the02more02secure,02the02happier02Dounia02is02with02him.02And02as02
for02some02defects02of02character,02for02some02habits02and02even02
certain02 differences02 of02 opinion―which02
indeed02 are02
inevitable02even02in02the02happiest02marriages―Dounia02has02
said02that,02as02regards02all02that,02she02relies02on02herself,02that02
there02is02nothing02to02be02uneasy02about,02and02that02she02is02ready02
to02put02up02with02a02great02deal,02if02only02their02future02relationship02
can02be02an02honourable02and02straightforward02one.02He02struck02
me,02for02instance,02at02first,02as02rather02abrupt,02but02that02may02
well02come02from02his02being02an02outspoken02man,02and02that02is02no02
doubt02how02it02is.02For02instance,02at02his02second02visit,02after02he02
had02 received02 Dounia's02 consent,02
the02 course02 of02
conversation,02he02declared02that02before02making02Dounia's02
acquaintance,02he02had02made02up02his02mind02to02marry02a02girl02of02
good02reputation,02without02dowry02and,02above02all,02one02who02
had02experienced02poverty,02because,02as02he02explained,02a02man02
ought02not02to02be02indebted02to02his02wife,02but02that02it02is02better02for02
a02wife02to02look02upon02her02husband02as02her02benefactor.02I02must02
add02that02he02expressed02it02more02nicely02and02politely02than02I02
have02done,02for02I02have02forgotten02his02actual02phrases02and02only02
remember02the02meaning.02And,02besides,02it02was02obviously02not02
said02of02design,02but02slipped02out02in02the02heat02of02conversation,02
so02that02he02tried02afterwards02to02correct02himself02and02smooth02
it02over,02but02all02the02same02it02did02strike02me02as02somewhat02rude,02
and02I02said02so02afterwards02to02Dounia.02But02Dounia02was02vexed,02
and02answered02that02'words02are02not02deeds,'02and02that,02of02
course,02is02perfectly02true.02Dounia02did02not02sleep02all02night02
before02she02made02up02her02mind,02and,02thinking02that02I02was02
asleep,02she02got02out02of02bed02and02was02walking02up02and02down02
in02
the02room02all02night;02at02last02she02knelt02down02before02the02ikon02
and02prayed02long02and02fervently02and02in02the02morning02she02told02
me02that02she02had02decided.0202
"I02have02mentioned02already02that02Pyotr02Petrovitch02is02just02
setting02off02for02Petersburg,02where02he02has02a02great02deal02of02
business,02and02he02wants02to02open02a02legal02bureau.02He02has02been02
for02 many02 years02
occupied02
in02 conducting02 civil02 and02
commercial02litigation,02and02only02the02other02day02he02won02an02
important02case.02He02has02to02be02in02Petersburg02because02he02has02
an02important02case02before02the02Senate.02So,02Rodya02dear,02he02
may02be02of02the02greatest02use02to02you,02in02every02way02indeed,02and02
Dounia02and02I02have02agreed02that02from02this02very02day02you02
could02definitely02enter02upon02your02career02and02might02

"It02shall02not02be?02But02what02are02you02going02to02do02to02

So02he02tortured02himself,02fretting02himself02with02such02
questions,02and02finding02a02kind02of02enjoyment02in02it.02And02yet02all02
these02questions02were02not02new02ones02suddenly02confronting02
him,02they02were02old02familiar02aches.02It02was02long02since02they02
had02first02begun02to02grip02and02rend02his02heart.02Long,02long02ago02
his02present02anguish02had02its02first02beginnings;02it02had02waxed02
and02gathered02strength,02it02had02matured02and02concentrated,02
until02it02had02taken02the02form02of02a02fearful,02frenzied02and02
fantastic02question,02which02tortured02his02heart02and02mind,02
clamouring02insistently02for02an02answer.02Now02his02mother's02
letter02had02burst02on02him02like02a02thunderclap.02It02was02clear02that02
he02must02not02now02suffer02passively,02worrying02himself02over02
unsolved02questions,02but02that02he02must02do02something,02do02it02
at02once,02and02do02it02quickly.02Anyway02he02must02decide02on02
something,02or02else...0202
"Or02throw02up02life02altogether!"02he02cried02suddenly,02in02a02
frenzy―"accept02one's02lot02humbly02as02it02is,02once02for02all02and02

"Do02you02understand,02sir,02do02you02understand02what02it02
means02when02you02have02absolutely02nowhere02to02turn?"02
Marmeladov's02question02came02suddenly02into02his02mind,02"for02
every02man02must02have02somewhere02to02turn...."0202
He02gave02a02sudden02start;02another02thought,02that02he02had02
had02yesterday,02slipped02back02into02his02mind.02But02he02did02not02
start02at02the02thought02recurring02to02him,02for02he02knew,02he02had02
felt02beforehand,02that02it02must02come02back,02he02was02expecting02
it;02besides02it02was02not02only02yesterday's02thought.02The02
difference02was02that02a02month02ago,02yesterday02even,02the02
thought02was02a02mere02dream:02but02now...02now02it02appeared02not02
a02dream02at02all,02it02had02taken02a02new02menacing02and02quite02
unfamiliar02shape,02and02he02suddenly02became02aware02of02this02
himself....02He02felt02a02hammering02in02his02head,02and02there02was02a02
darkness02before02his02eyes.0202
He02looked02round02hurriedly,02he02was02searching02for02
something.02He02wanted02to02sit02down02and02was02looking02for02a02
seat;02he02was02walking02along02the02K――02Boulevard.02There02
was02a02seat02about02a02hundred02paces02in02front02of02him.02He02
walked02towards02it02as02fast02he02could;02but02on02the02way02he02met02
with02a02little02adventure02which02absorbed02all02his02attention.02
Looking02for02the02seat,02he02had02noticed02a02woman02walking02
some02twenty02paces02in02front02of02him,02but02at02first02he02took02no02
more02notice02of02her02than02of02other02objects02that02crossed02his02
path.02It02had02happened02to02him02many02times02going02home02not02
to02notice02the02road02by02which02he02was02going,02and02he02was02
accustomed02to02walk02like02that.02But02there02was02at02first02sight02
something02so02strange02about02the02woman02in02front02of02him,02
that02gradually02his02attention02was02riveted02upon02her,02at02first02
reluctantly02and,02as02it02were,02resentfully,02and02then02more02and02
more02intently.02He02felt02a02sudden02desire02to02find02out02what02it02
was02that02was02so02strange02about02the02woman.02In02the02first02
place,02she02appeared02to02be02a02girl02quite02young,02and02she02was02
walking02in02the02great02heat02bareheaded02and02with02no02parasol02
or02gloves,02waving02her02arms02about02in02an02absurd02way.02She02
had02on02a02dress02of02some02light02silky02material,02but02put02on02
strangely02awry,02not02properly02hooked02up,02and02torn02open02at02
the02top02of02the02skirt,02close02to02the02waist:02a02great02piece02was02
rent02and02hanging02loose.02A02little02kerchief02was02flung02about02
her02bare02throat,02but02lay02slanting02on02one02side.02The02girl02was02
walking02unsteadily,02too,02stumbling02and02staggering02from02
side02to02side.02She02drew02Raskolnikov's02whole02attention02at02
last.02He02overtook02the02girl02at02the02seat,02but,02on02reaching02it,02
she02dropped02down02on02it,02in02the02corner;02she02let02her02head02
sink02on02the02back02of02the02seat02and02closed02her02eyes,02
apparently02in02extreme02exhaustion.02Looking02at02her02closely,02
he02saw02at02once02that02she02was02completely02drunk.02It02was02a02
strange02and02shocking02sight.02He02could02hardly02believe02that02he02
was02not02mistaken.02He02saw02before02him02the02face02of02a02quite02
young,02fair\haired02girl―sixteen,02perhaps02not02more02than02
fifteen,02years02old,02pretty02little02face,02but02flushed02and02heavy02
looking02and,02as02it02were,02swollen.02The02girl02seemed02hardly02to02
know02what02she02was02doing;02she02crossed02one02leg02over02the02
other,02lifting02it02indecorously,02and02showed02every02sign02of02
being02unconscious02that02she02was02in02the02street.0202
Raskolnikov02did02not02sit02down,02but02he02felt02unwilling02to02
leave02her,02and02stood02facing02her02in02perplexity.02This02
boulevard02was02never02much02frequented;02and02now,02at02two02
o'clock,02in02the02stifling02heat,02it02was02quite02deserted.02And02yet02
on02the02further02side02of02the02boulevard,02about02fifteen02paces02
away,02a02gentleman02was02standing02on02the02edge02of02the02
pavement.02He,02too,02would02apparently02have02liked02to02
approach02the02girl02with02some02object02of02his02own.02He,02too,02had02
probably02seen02her02in02the02distance02and02had02followed02her,02
but02found02Raskolnikov02in02his02way.02He02looked02angrily02at02
him,02though02he02tried02to02escape02his02notice,02and02stood02
impatiently02biding02his02time,02till02the02unwelcome02man02in02rags02
should02 have02 moved02 away.02 His02
intentions02 were02
unmistakable.02The02gentleman02was02a02plump,02thickly\set02
man,02about02thirty,02fashionably02dressed,02with02a02high02colour,02
red02lips02and02moustaches.02Raskolnikov02felt02furious;02he02had02a02
sudden02longing02to02insult02this02fat02dandy02in02some02way.02He02
left02the02girl02for02a02moment02and02walked02towards02the02
gentleman.0202
"Hey!02You02Svidriga07lov!02What02do02you02want02here?"02he02
shouted,02clenching02his02fists02and02laughing,02spluttering02with02
rage.0202"What02do02you02mean?"02the02gentleman02asked02sternly,02
scowling02in02haughty02astonishment.0202
"Get02away,02that's02what02I02mean."0202
"How02dare02you,02you02low02fellow!"0202
He02raised02his02cane.02Raskolnikov02rushed02at02him02with02his02
fists,02without02reflecting02that02the02stout02gentleman02was02a02
match02for02two02men02like02himself.02But02at02that02instant02
someone02seized02him02from02behind,02and02a02police02constable02
stood02between02them.0202
"That's02enough,02gentlemen,02no02fighting,02please,02in02a02
public02place.02What02do02you02want?02Who02are02you?"02he02asked02
Raskolnikov02sternly,02noticing02his02rags.0202
Raskolnikov02looked02at02him02intently.02He02had02a02straight\
forward,02sensible,02soldierly02face,02with02grey02moustaches02
and02whiskers.0202
"You02are02just02the02man02I02want,"02Raskolnikov02cried,02
catching02at02his02arm.02"I02am02a02student,02Raskolnikov....02You02
may02as02well02know02that02too,"02he02added,02addressing02the02
gentleman,02"come02along,02I02have02something02to02show02you."0202
And02taking02the02policeman02by02the02hand02he02drew02him02
towards02the02seat.0202
"Look02here,02hopelessly02drunk,02and02she02has02just02come02
down02the02boulevard.02There02is02no02telling02who02and02what02she02
is,02she02does02not02look02like02a02professional.02It's02more02likely02she02
has02been02given02drink02and02deceived02somewhere...02for02the02
first02time...02you02understand?02and02they've02put02her02out02into02
the02street02like02that.02Look02at02the02way02her02dress02is02torn,02and02
the02way02it02has02been02put02on:02she02has02been02dressed02by02
somebody,02she02has02not02dressed02herself,02and02dressed02by02
unpractised02hands,02by02a02man's02hands;02that's02evident.02And02
now02look02there:02I02don't02know02that02dandy02with02whom02I02was02
going02to02fight,02I02see02him02for02the02first02time,02but02he,02too,02has02
seen02her02on02the02road,02just02now,02drunk,02not02knowing02what02
she02is02doing,02and02now02he02is02very02eager02to02get02hold02of02her,02to02
get02her02away02somewhere02while02she02is02in02this02state...02that's02
certain,02believe02me,02I02am02not02wrong.02I02saw02him02myself02
watching02her02and02following02her,02but02I02prevented02him,02and02
he02is02just02waiting02for02me02to02go02away.02Now02he02has02walked02
away02a02little,02and02is02standing02still,02pretending02to02make02a02
cigarette....02Think02how02can02we02keep02her02out02of02his02hands,02
and02how02are02we02to02get02her02home?"0202
The02policeman02saw02it02all02in02a02flash.02The02stout02gentleman02
was02easy02to02understand,02he02turned02to02consider02the02girl.02The02
policeman02bent02over02to02examine02her02more02closely,02and02his02
face02worked02with02genuine02compassion.0202
"Ah,02what02a02pity!"02he02said,02shaking02his02head―"why,02she02
is02quite02a02child!02She02has02been02deceived,02you02can02see02that02at02
once.02Listen,02lady,"02he02began02addressing02her,02"where02do02
you02live?"02The02girl02opened02her02weary02and02sleepy\looking02
eyes,02gazed02blankly02at02the02speaker02and02waved02her02hand.0202
"Here,"02said02Raskolnikov02feeling02in02his02pocket02and02
finding02twenty02copecks,02"here,02call02a02cab02and02tell02him02to02
drive02her02to02her02address.02The02only02thing02is02to02find02out02her02
address!"0202
"Missy,02missy!"02the02policeman02began02again,02taking02the02
money.02"I'll02fetch02you02a02cab02and02take02you02home02myself.02
Where02shall02I02take02you,02eh?02Where02do02you02live?"0202
"Go02away!02They02won't02let02me02alone,"02the02girl02muttered,02
and02once02more02waved02her02hand.0202
"Ach,02ach,02how02shocking!02It's02shameful,02missy,02it's02a02
shame!"02He02shook02his02head02again,02shocked,02sympathetic02
and02indignant.0202
"It's02a02difficult02job,"02the02policeman02said02to02Raskolnikov,02
and02as02he02did02so,02he02looked02him02up02and02down02in02a02rapid02
glance.02He,02too,02must02have02seemed02a02strange02figure02to02him:02
dressed02in02rags02and02handing02him02money!0202
"Did02you02meet02her02far02from02here?"02he02asked02him.0202
"I02tell02you02she02was02walking02in02front02of02me,02staggering,02
just02here,02in02the02boulevard.02She02only02just02reached02the02seat02
and02sank02down02on02it."0202
"Ah,02the02shameful02things02that02are02done02in02the02world02
nowadays,02God02have02mercy02on02us!02An02innocent02creature02
like02that,02drunk02already!02She02has02been02deceived,02that's02a02
sure02thing.02See02how02her02dress02has02been02torn02too....02Ah,02the02
vice02one02sees02nowadays!02And02as02likely02as02not02she02belongs02
to02gentlefolk02too,02poor02ones02maybe....02There02are02many02like02
that02nowadays.02She02looks02refined,02too,02as02though02she02were02
a02lady,"02and02he02bent02over02her02once02more.0202
Perhaps02he02had02daughters02growing02up02like02that,02
"looking02like02ladies02and02refined"02with02pretensions02to02
gentility02and02smartness....0202
"The02chief02thing02is,"02Raskolnikov02persisted,02"to02keep02her02
out02of02this02scoundrel's02hands!02Why02should02he02outrage02her!02
It's02as02clear02as02day02what02he02is02after;02ah,02the02brute,02he02is02not02
moving02off!"0202
Raskolnikov02spoke02aloud02and02pointed02to02him.02The02
gentleman02heard02him,02and02seemed02about02to02fly02into02a02rage02
again,02but02thought02better02of02it,02and02confined02himself02to02a02
contemptuous02look.02He02then02walked02slowly02another02ten02
paces02away02and02again02halted.0202
"Keep02her02out02of02his02hands02we02can,"02said02the02constable02
thoughtfully,02"if02only02she'd02tell02us02where02to02take02her,02but02as02
it02is....02Missy,02hey,02missy!"02he02bent02over02her02once02more.0202
She02opened02her02eyes02fully02all02of02a02sudden,02looked02at02him02
intently,02as02though02realising02something,02got02up02from02the02
seat02and02walked02away02in02the02direction02from02which02she02had02
come.02"Oh02shameful02wretches,02they02won't02let02me02alone!"02
she02said,02waving02her02hand02again.02She02walked02quickly,02
though02staggering02as02before.02The02dandy02followed02her,02but02
along02another02avenue,02keeping02his02eye02on02her.0202
"Don't02be02anxious,02I02won't02let02him02have02her,"02the02
policeman02said02resolutely,02and02he02set02off02after02them.0202
"Ah,02the02vice02one02sees02nowadays!"02he02repeated02aloud,02
sighing.0202
to02
At02
sting02
seemed02
that02 moment02
Raskolnikov;02in02an02instant02a02complete02revulsion02of02feeling02
came02over02him.0202
"Hey,02here!"02he02shouted02after02the02policeman.0202
The02latter02turned02round.0202
"Let02them02be!02What02is02it02to02do02with02you?02Let02her02go!02Let02
him02amuse02himself."02He02pointed02at02the02dandy,02"What02is02it02
to02do02with02you?"0202
The02policeman02was02bewildered,02and02stared02at02him02
open\eyed.02Raskolnikov02laughed.0202
"Well!"02ejaculated02the02policeman,02with02a02gesture02of02
contempt,02and02he02walked02after02the02dandy02and02the02girl,02
probably02taking02Raskolnikov02for02a02madman02or02something02
even02worse.0202
"He02has02carried02off02my02twenty02copecks,"02Raskolnikov02
murmured02angrily02when02he02was02left02alone.02"Well,02let02him02
something02
take02as02much02from02the02other02fellow02to02allow02him02to02have02
the02girl02and02so02let02it02end.02And02why02did02I02want02to02interfere?02
Is02it02for02me02to02help?02Have02I02any02right02to02help?02Let02them02
devour02each02other02alive―what02is02to02me?02How02did02I02dare02to02
give02him02twenty02copecks?02Were02they02mine?"0202
In02spite02of02those02strange02words02he02felt02very02wretched.02
He02sat02down02on02the02deserted02seat.02His02thoughts02strayed02
aimlessly....02He02found02it02hard02to02fix02his02mind02on02anything02at02
that02moment.02He02longed02to02forget02himself02altogether,02to02
forget02everything,02and02then02to02wake02up02and02begin02life02
anew....0202
"Poor02girl!"02he02said,02looking02at02the02empty02corner02where02
she02had02sat―"She02will02come02to02herself02and02weep,02and02then02
her02mother02will02find02out....02She02will02give02her02a02beating,02a02
horrible,02shameful02beating02and02then02maybe,02turn02her02out02of02
doors....02And02even02if02she02does02not,02the02Darya02Frantsovnas02
will02get02wind02of02it,02and02the02girl02will02soon02be02slipping02out02on02
the02sly02here02and02there.02Then02there02will02be02the02hospital02
directly02(that's02always02the02luck02of02those02girls02with02
respectable02mothers,02who02go02wrong02on02the02sly)02and02then...02
again02the02hospital...02drink...02the02taverns...02and02more02
hospital,02in02two02or02three02years―a02wreck,02and02her02life02over02
at02eighteen02or02nineteen....02Have02not02I02seen02cases02like02that?02
And02how02have02they02been02brought02to02it?02Why,02they've02all02
come02to02it02like02that.02Ugh!02But02what02does02it02matter?02That's02as02
it02should02be,02they02tell02us.02A02certain02percentage,02they02tell02us,02
must02every02year02go...02that02way...02to02the02devil,02I02suppose,02so02
that02the02rest02may02remain02chaste,02and02not02be02interfered02
with.02A02percentage!02What02splendid02words02they02have;02they02
are02so02scientific,02so02consolatory....02Once02you've02said02
'percentage'02there's02nothing02more02to02worry02about.02If02we02
had02any02other02word...02maybe02we02might02feel02more02uneasy....02
But02what02if02Dounia02were02one02of02the02percentage!02Of02another02
one02if02not02that02one?0202
"But02where02am02I02going?"02he02thought02suddenly.02"Strange,02
I02came02out02for02something.02As02soon02as02I02had02read02the02letter02I02
came02out....02I02was02going02to02Vassilyevsky02Ostrov,02to02
Razumihin.02That's02what02it02was...02now02I02remember.02What02
for,02though?02And02what02put02the02idea02of02going02to02Razumihin02
into02my02head02just02now?02That's02curious."0202
He02wondered02at02himself.02Razumihin02was02one02of02his02old02
comrades02at02the02university.02It02was02remarkable02that02
Raskolnikov02had02hardly02any02friends02at02the02university;02he02
kept02aloof02from02everyone,02went02to02see02no02one,02and02did02not02
welcome02anyone02who02came02to02see02him,02and02indeed02
everyone02soon02gave02him02up.02He02took02no02part02in02the02
students'02gatherings,02amusements02or02conversations.02He02
worked02with02great02intensity02without02sparing02himself,02and02
he02was02respected02for02this,02but02no02one02liked02him.02He02was02
very02poor,02and02there02was02a02sort02of02haughty02pride02and02
reserve02about02him,02as02though02he02were02keeping02something02
to02himself.02He02seemed02to02some02of02his02comrades02to02look02
down02upon02them02all02as02children,02as02though02he02were02
superior02in02development,02knowledge02and02convictions,02as02
though02their02beliefs02and02interests02were02beneath02him.0202
With02Razumihin02he02had02got02on,02or,02at02least,02he02was02more02
unreserved02and02communicative02with02him.02Indeed02it02was02
impossible02to02be02on02any02other02terms02with02Razumihin.02He02
was02an02exceptionally02good\humoured02and02candid02youth,02
good\natured02to02the02point02of02simplicity,02though02both02depth02
and02dignity02lay02concealed02under02that02simplicity.02The02better02
of02his02comrades02understood02this,02and02all02were02fond02of02him.02
He02was02extremely02intelligent,02though02he02was02certainly02
rather02 a02 simpleton02 at02
times.02 He02 was02 of02 striking02
appearance―tall,02thin,02blackhaired02and02always02badly02
shaved.02He02was02sometimes02uproarious02and02was02reputed02to02
be02of02great02physical02strength.02One02night,02when02out02in02a02
festive02company,02he02had02with02one02blow02laid02a02gigantic02
policeman02on02his02back.02There02was02no02limit02to02his02drinking02
powers,02but02he02could02abstain02from02drink02altogether;02he02
sometimes02went02too02far02in02his02pranks;02but02he02could02do02
without02pranks02altogether.02Another02thing02striking02about02
Razumihin,02no02failure02distressed02him,02and02it02seemed02as02
though02no02unfavourable02circumstances02could02crush02him.02
He02could02lodge02anywhere,02and02bear02the02extremes02of02cold02
and02hunger.02He02was02very02poor,02and02kept02himself02entirely02
on02what02he02could02earn02by02work02of02one02sort02or02another.02He02
knew02of02no02end02of02resources02by02which02to02earn02money.02He02
spent02one02whole02winter02without02lighting02his02stove,02and02
used02to02declare02that02he02liked02it02better,02because02one02slept02
more02soundly02in02the02cold.02For02the02present02he,02too,02had02been02
obliged02to02give02up02the02university,02but02it02was02only02for02a02time,02
and02he02was02working02with02all02his02might02to02save02enough02to02
return02to02his02studies02again.02Raskolnikov02had02not02been02to02
see02him02for02the02last02four02months,02and02Razumihin02did02not02
even02know02his02address.02About02two02months02before,02they02
had02met02in02the02street,02but02Raskolnikov02had02turned02away02
and02even02crossed02to02the02other02side02that02he02might02not02be02
observed.02And02though02Razumihin02noticed02him,02he02passed02
him02by,02as02he02did02not02want02to02annoy02him.0202

It's02really02absurd02for02me02to02go02to02Razumihin...."0202
The02question02why02he02was02now02going02to02Razumihin02
agitated02him02even02more02than02he02was02himself02aware;02he02
kept02uneasily02seeking02for02some02sinister02significance02in02this02
apparently02ordinary02action.0202
"Could02I02have02expected02to02set02it02all02straight02and02to02find02a02
way02out02by02means02of02Razumihin02alone?"02he02asked02himself02
in02perplexity.0202
He02pondered02and02rubbed02his02forehead,02and,02strange02to02
say,02 after02
it02 were02
spontaneously02and02by02chance,02a02fantastic02thought02came02
into02his02head.0202
"Hm...02to02Razumihin's,"02he02said02all02at02once,02calmly,02as02
though02he02had02reached02a02final02determination.02"I02shall02go02to02
Razumihin's02of02course,02but...02not02now.02I02shall02go02to02him...02on02
the02next02day02after02It,02when02It02will02be02over02and02everything02
will02begin02afresh...."0202
And02suddenly02he02realised02what02he02was02thinking.0202
"After02It,"02he02shouted,02jumping02up02from02the02seat,02"but02is02
It02really02going02to02happen?02Is02it02possible02it02really02will02
happen?"02He02left02the02seat,02and02went02off02almost02at02a02run;02he02
meant02to02turn02back,02homewards,02but02the02thought02of02going02
long02 musing,02 suddenly,02 as02
if02
home02suddenly02filled02him02with02intense02loathing;02in02that02
hole,02in02that02awful02little02cupboard02of02his,02all02this02had02for02a02
month02past02been02growing02up02in02him;02and02he02walked02on02at02
random.0202
His02nervous02shudder02had02passed02into02a02fever02that02made02
him02feel02shivering;02in02spite02of02the02heat02he02felt02cold.02With02a02
kind02of02effort02he02began02almost02unconsciously,02from02some02
inner02craving,02to02stare02at02all02the02objects02before02him,02as02
though02looking02for02something02to02distract02his02attention;02but02
he02did02not02succeed,02and02kept02dropping02every02moment02into02
brooding.02When02with02a02start02he02lifted02his02head02again02and02
looked02round,02he02forgot02at02once02what02he02had02just02been02
thinking02about02and02even02where02he02was02going.02In02this02way02
he02walked02right02across02Vassilyevsky02Ostrov,02came02out02on02
to02the02Lesser02Neva,02crossed02the02bridge02and02turned02towards02
the02islands.02The02greenness02and02freshness02were02at02first02
restful02to02his02weary02eyes02after02the02dust02of02the02town02and02the02
huge02houses02that02hemmed02him02in02and02weighed02upon02him.02
Here02there02were02no02taverns,02no02stifling02closeness,02no02
stench.02But02soon02these02new02pleasant02sensations02passed02
into02morbid02irritability.02Sometimes02he02stood02still02before02a02
brightly02painted02summer02villa02standing02among02green02
foliage,02he02gazed02through02the02fence,02he02saw02in02the02distance02
smartly02dressed02women02on02the02verandahs02and02balconies,02
and02 children02 running02
flowers02
especially02caught02his02attention;02he02gazed02at02them02longer02
than02at02anything.02He02was02met,02too,02by02luxurious02carriages02
and02by02men02and02women02on02horseback;02he02watched02them02
with02curious02eyes02and02forgot02about02them02before02they02had02
vanished02from02his02sight.02Once02he02stood02still02and02counted02
his02money;02he02found02he02had02thirty02copecks.02"Twenty02to02the02

in02 the02 gardens.02 The02
he02thought,02reckoning02it02up02for02some02unknown02reason,02but02
he02soon02forgot02with02what02object02he02had02taken02the02money02
out02of02his02pocket.02He02recalled02it02on02passing02an02eating\house02
or02tavern,02and02felt02that02he02was02hungry....02Going02into02the02
tavern02he02drank02a02glass02of02vodka02and02ate02a02pie02of02some02sort.02
He02finished02eating02it02as02he02walked02away.02It02was02a02long02
while02since02he02had02taken02vodka02and02it02had02an02effect02upon02
him02at02once,02though02he02only02drank02a02wineglassful.02His02legs02
felt02suddenly02heavy02and02a02great02drowsiness02came02upon02
him.02He02turned02homewards,02but02reaching02Petrovsky02
Ostrov02he02stopped02completely02exhausted,02turned02off02the02
road02into02the02bushes,02sank02down02upon02the02grass02and02
instantly02fell02asleep.0202
In02a02morbid02condition02of02the02brain,02dreams02often02have02a02
singular02actuality,02vividness,02and02extraordinary02semblance02
of02reality.02At02times02monstrous02images02are02created,02but02the02

a02child02about02seven02years02old,02walking02into02the02country02
with02his02father02on02the02evening02of02a02holiday.02It02was02a02grey02

of02the02horizon.02A02few02paces02beyond02the02last02market02garden02
stood02a02tavern,02a02big02tavern,02which02had02always02aroused02in02
him02a02feeling02of02aversion,02even02of02fear,02when02he02walked02by02
it02with02his02father.02There02was02always02a02crowd02there,02always02
shouting,02laughter02and02abuse,02hideous02hoarse02singing02and02
often02fighting.02Drunken02and02horrible\looking02figures02were02
hanging02about02the02tavern.02He02used02to02cling02close02to02his02
father,02trembling02all02over02when02he02met02them.02Near02the02
tavern02the02road02became02a02dusty02track,02the02dust02of02which02
was02always02black.02It02was02a02winding02road,02and02about02a02
hundred02paces02further02on,02it02turned02to02the02right02to02the02
graveyard.02In02the02middle02of02the02graveyard02stood02a02stone02
church02with02a02green02cupola02where02he02used02to02go02to02mass02
two02or02three02times02a02year02with02his02father02and02mother,02
when02a02service02was02held02in02memory02of02his02grandmother,02

old\fashioned,02unadorned02ikons02and02the02old02priest02with02the02
shaking02head.02Near02his02grandmother's02grave,02which02was02
marked02by02a02stone,02was02the02little02grave02of02his02younger02

religiously02and02reverently02to02cross02himself02and02to02bow02
down02and02kiss02the02little02grave.02And02now02he02dreamt02that02he02
was02walking02with02his02father02past02the02tavern02on02the02way02to02
the02graveyard;02he02was02holding02his02father's02hand02and02
looking02with02dread02at02the02tavern.02A02peculiar02circumstance02
attracted02his02attention:02there02seemed02to02be02some02kind02of02
festivity02going02on,02there02were02crowds02of02gaily02dressed02
townspeople,02peasant02women,02their02husbands,02and02riff\raff02
of02all02sorts,02all02singing02and02all02more02or02less02drunk.02Near02the02
entrance02of02the02tavern02stood02a02cart,02but02a02strange02cart.02It02
was02one02of02those02big02carts02usually02drawn02by02heavy02cart\
horses02and02laden02with02casks02of02wine02or02other02heavy02goods.02
He02always02liked02looking02at02those02great02cart\horses,02with02
their02long02manes,02thick02legs,02and02slow02even02pace,02drawing02
along02a02perfect02mountain02with02no02appearance02of02effort,02as02
though02it02were02easier02going02with02a02load02than02without02it.02
But02now,02strange02to02say,02in02the02shafts02of02such02a02cart02he02saw02
a02thin02little02sorrel02beast,02one02of02those02peasants'02nags02which02
he02had02often02seen02straining02their02utmost02under02a02heavy02
load02of02wood02or02hay,02especially02when02the02wheels02were02
stuck02in02the02mud02or02in02a02rut.02And02the02peasants02would02beat02
them02so02cruelly,02sometimes02even02about02the02nose02and02eyes,02
and02he02felt02so02sorry,02so02sorry02for02them02that02he02almost02cried,02
and02his02mother02always02used02to02take02him02away02from02the02
window.02All02of02a02sudden02there02was02a02great02uproar02of02
shouting,02singing02and02the02balala07ka,02and02from02the02tavern02a02
number02of02big02and02very02drunken02peasants02came02out,02
wearing02red02and02blue02shirts02and02coats02thrown02over02their02
shoulders.0202
"Get02in,02get02in!"02shouted02one02of02them,02a02young02thick\
necked02peasant02with02a02fleshy02face02red02as02a02carrot.02"I'll02take02
you02all,02get02in!"0202
But02at02once02there02was02an02outbreak02of02laughter02and02
exclamations02in02the02crowd.0202
"Take02us02all02with02a02beast02like02that!"0202
"Why,02Mikolka,02are02you02crazy02to02put02a02nag02like02that02in02

"And02this02mare02is02twenty02if02she02is02a02day,02mates!"0202
"Get02in,02I'll02take02you02all,"02Mikolka02shouted02again,02leaping02
first02into02the02cart,02seizing02the02reins02and02standing02straight02
up02in02front.02"The02bay02has02gone02with02Matvey,"02he02shouted02
from02the02cart―"and02this02brute,02mates,02is02just02breaking02my02

he02picked02up02the02whip,02preparing02himself02with02relish02to02
flog02the02little02mare.0202
"Get02in!02Come02along!"02The02crowd02laughed.02"D'you02hear,02

"Gallop02indeed!02She02has02not02had02a02gallop02in02her02for02the02

"She'll02jog02along!"0202
"Don't02you02mind02her,02mates,02bring02a02whip02each02of02you,02

"All02right!02Give02it02to02her!"0202
They02all02clambered02into02Mikolka's02cart,02laughing02and02
making02jokes.02Six02men02got02in02and02there02was02still02room02for02

thick02leather02shoes;02she02was02cracking02nuts02and02laughing.02
The02crowd02round02them02was02laughing02too02and02indeed,02how02
could02they02help02laughing?02That02wretched02nag02was02to02drag02
all02the02cartload02of02them02at02a02gallop!02Two02young02fellows02in02
the02cart02were02just02getting02whips02ready02to02help02Mikolka.02
With02the02cry02of02"now,"02the02mare02tugged02with02all02her02might,02
but02far02from02galloping,02could02scarcely02move02forward;02she02
struggled02with02her02legs,02gasping02and02shrinking02from02the02
blows02of02the02three02whips02which02were02showered02upon02her02
like02hail.02The02laughter02in02the02cart02and02in02the02crowd02was02
redoubled,02but02Mikolka02flew02into02a02rage02and02furiously02
thrashed02the02mare,02as02though02he02supposed02she02really02could02

"Let02me02get02in,02too,02mates,"02shouted02a02young02man02in02the02
crowd02whose02appetite02was02aroused.0202
"Get02in,02all02get02in,"02cried02Mikolka,02"she02will02draw02you02all.02
I'll02beat02her02to02death!"02And02he02thrashed02and02thrashed02at02the02

"Father,02father,"02he02cried,02"father,02what02are02they02doing?02
Father,02they02are02beating02the02poor02horse!"0202
"Come02along,02come02along!"02said02his02father.02"They02are02

away02from02his02hand,02and,02beside02himself02with02horror,02ran02
to02the02horse.02The02poor02beast02was02in02a02bad02way.02She02was02
gasping,02standing02still,02then02tugging02again02and02almost02
falling.0202
"Beat02her02to02death,"02cried02Mikolka,02"it's02come02to02that.02I'll02
do02for02her!"0202
"What02are02you02about,02are02you02a02Christian,02you02devil?"02
shouted02an02old02man02in02the02crowd.0202
"Did02anyone02ever02see02the02like?02A02wretched02nag02like02that02

"You'll02kill02her,"02shouted02the02third.0202
"Don't02meddle!02It's02my02property,02I'll02do02what02I02choose.02

All02at02once02laughter02broke02into02a02roar02and02covered02
everything:02the02mare,02roused02by02the02shower02of02blows,02
began02feebly02kicking.02Even02the02old02man02could02not02help02
smiling.02To02think02of02a02wretched02little02beast02like02that02trying02

Two02lads02in02the02crowd02snatched02up02whips02and02ran02to02

"Hit02her02in02the02face,02in02the02eyes,02in02the02eyes,"02cried02
Mikolka.0202
"Give02us02a02song,02mates,"02shouted02someone02in02the02cart02

crying,02he02felt02choking,02his02tears02were02streaming.02One02of02
the02men02gave02him02a02cut02with02the02whip02across02the02face,02he02

mare.02She02was02almost02at02the02last02gasp,02but02began02kicking02
once02more.0202
"I'll02teach02you02to02kick,"02Mikolka02shouted02ferociously.02He02
threw02down02the02whip,02bent02forward02and02picked02up02from02
the02bottom02of02the02cart02a02long,02thick02shaft,02he02took02hold02of02
one02end02with02both02hands02and02with02an02effort02brandished02it02
over02the02mare.0202
"He'll02crush02her,"02was02shouted02round02him.02"He'll02kill02
her!"0202"It's02my02property,"02shouted02Mikolka02and02brought02the02
shaft02down02with02a02swinging02blow.02There02was02a02sound02of02a02
heavy02thud.0202
"Thrash02her,02thrash02her!02Why02have02you02stopped?"02
shouted02voices02in02the02crowd.0202
And02Mikolka02swung02the02shaft02a02second02time02and02it02fell02a02
second02time02on02the02spine02of02the02luckless02mare.02She02sank02
back02on02her02haunches,02but02lurched02forward02and02tugged02
forward02with02all02her02force,02tugged02first02on02one02side02and02
then02on02the02other,02trying02to02move02the02cart.02But02the02six02
whips02were02attacking02her02in02all02directions,02and02the02shaft02
was02raised02again02and02fell02upon02her02a02third02time,02then02a02
fourth,02with02heavy02measured02blows.02Mikolka02was02in02a02fury02
that02he02could02not02kill02her02at02one02blow.0202
"She's02a02tough02one,"02was02shouted02in02the02crowd.0202
"She'll02fall02in02a02minute,02mates,02there02will02soon02be02an02end02
of02her,"02said02an02admiring02spectator02in02the02crowd.0202
"Fetch02an02axe02to02her!02Finish02her02off,"02shouted02a02third.0202
"I'll02show02you!02Stand02off,"02Mikolka02screamed02frantically;02
he02threw02down02the02shaft,02stooped02down02in02the02cart02and02
picked02up02an02iron02crowbar.02"Look02out,"02he02shouted,02and02
with02all02his02might02he02dealt02a02stunning02blow02at02the02poor02
mare.02The02blow02fell;02the02mare02staggered,02sank02back,02tried02
to02pull,02but02the02bar02fell02again02with02a02swinging02blow02on02her02
back02and02she02fell02on02the02ground02like02a02log.0202
"Finish02her02off,"02shouted02Mikolka02and02he02leapt02beside02
himself,02out02of02the02cart.02Several02young02men,02also02flushed02
with02drink,02seized02anything02they02could02come02across―
whips,02sticks,02poles,02and02ran02to02the02dying02mare.02Mikolka02
stood02on02one02side02and02began02dealing02random02blows02with02
the02crowbar.02The02mare02stretched02out02her02head,02drew02a02long02
breath02and02died.0202
"You02butchered02her,"02someone02shouted02in02the02crowd.0202
"Why02wouldn't02she02gallop02then?"0202
"My02property!"02shouted02Mikolka,02with02bloodshot02eyes,02
brandishing02the02bar02in02his02hands.02He02stood02as02though02
regretting02that02he02had02nothing02more02to02beat.0202
"No02mistake02about02it,02you02are02not02a02Christian,"02many02
voices02were02shouting02in02the02crowd.0202
But02the02poor02boy,02beside02himself,02made02his02way,02
screaming,02through02the02crowd02to02the02sorrel02nag,02put02his02
arms02round02her02bleeding02dead02head02and02kissed02it,02kissed02
the02eyes02and02kissed02the02lips....02Then02he02jumped02up02and02flew02
in02a02frenzy02with02his02little02fists02out02at02Mikolka.02At02that02
instant02his02father,02who02had02been02running02after02him,02
snatched02him02up02and02carried02him02out02of02the02crowd.0202
"Come02along,02come!02Let02us02go02home,"02he02said02to02him.0202
"Father!02Why02did02they...02kill...02the02poor02horse!"02he02
sobbed,02but02his02voice02broke02and02the02words02came02in02shrieks02
from02his02panting02chest.0202
"They02are02drunk....02They02are02brutal...02it's02not02our02
business!"02said02his02father.02He02put02his02arms02round02his02father02
but02he02felt02choked,02choked.02He02tried02to02draw02a02breath,02to02
cry02out―and02woke02up.0202
He02waked02up,02gasping02for02breath,02his02hair02soaked02with02
perspiration,02and02stood02up02in02terror.0202
"Thank02God,02that02was02only02a02dream,"02he02said,02sitting02
down02under02a02tree02and02drawing02deep02breaths.02"But02what02is02
it?02Is02it02some02fever02coming02on?02Such02a02hideous02dream!"0202
He02felt02utterly02broken:02darkness02and02confusion02were02in02
his02soul.02He02rested02his02elbows02on02his02knees02and02leaned02his02
head02on02his02hands.0202
"Good02God!"02he02cried,02"can02it02be,02can02it02be,02that02I02shall02
really02take02an02axe,02that02I02shall02strike02her02on02the02head,02split02

blood...02with02the02axe....02Good02God,02can02it02be?"0202
He02was02shaking02like02a02leaf02as02he02said02this.0202
"But02why02am02I02going02on02like02this?"02he02continued,02sitting02
up02again,02as02it02were02in02profound02amazement.02"I02knew02that02I02
could02never02bring02myself02to02it,02so02what02have02I02been02
torturing02myself02for02till02now?02Yesterday,02yesterday,02when02I02
went02to02make02that...02 experiment,02yesterday02I02realised02
completely02that02I02could02never02bear02to02do02it....02Why02am02I02
going02over02it02again,02then?02Why02am02I02hesitating?02As02I02came02
down02the02stairs02yesterday,02I02said02myself02that02it02was02base,02
loathsome,02vile,02vile...02the02very02thought02of02it02made02me02feel02
sick02and02filled02me02with02horror.0202
"No,02I02couldn't02do02it,02I02couldn't02do02it!02Granted,02granted02

I02couldn't02do02it,02I02couldn't02do02it!02Why,02why02then02am02I02still...?"0202
He02rose02to02his02feet,02looked02round02in02wonder02as02though02
surprised02at02finding02himself02in02this02place,02and02went02
towards02the02bridge.02He02was02pale,02his02eyes02glowed,02he02was02
exhausted02in02every02limb,02but02he02seemed02suddenly02to02
breathe02more02easily.02He02felt02he02had02cast02off02that02fearful02
burden02that02had02so02long02been02weighing02upon02him,02and02all02
at02once02there02was02a02sense02of02relief02and02peace02in02his02soul.02
"Lord,"02he02prayed,02"show02me02my02path―I02renounce02that02
accursed...02dream02of02mine."0202
Crossing02the02bridge,02he02gazed02quietly02and02calmly02at02the02
Neva,02at02the02glowing02red02sun02setting02in02the02glowing02sky.02In02
spite02of02his02weakness02he02was02not02conscious02of02fatigue.02It02
was02as02though02an02abscess02that02had02been02forming02for02a02
month02past02in02his02heart02had02suddenly02broken.02Freedom,02
freedom!02He02was02free02from02that02spell,02that02sorcery,02that02
obsession!0202
Later02on,02when02he02recalled02that02time02and02all02that02
happened02to02him02during02those02days,02minute02by02minute,02
point02by02point,02he02was02superstitiously02impressed02by02one02
circumstance,02which,02though02in02itself02not02very02exceptional,02
always02seemed02to02him02afterwards02the02predestined02turning\
point02of02his02fate.02He02could02never02understand02and02explain02to02
himself02why,02when02he02was02tired02and02worn02out,02when02it02
would02have02been02more02convenient02for02him02to02go02home02by02
the02shortest02and02most02direct02way,02he02had02returned02by02the02
Hay02Market02where02he02had02no02need02to02go.02It02was02obviously02
and02quite02unnecessarily02out02of02his02way,02though02not02much02
so.02It02is02true02that02it02happened02to02him02dozens02of02times02to02
return02home02without02noticing02what02streets02he02passed02
through.02But02why,02he02was02always02asking02himself,02why02had02
such02an02important,02such02a02decisive02and02at02the02same02time02
such02an02absolutely02chance02meeting02happened02in02the02Hay02
Market02(where02he02had02moreover02no02reason02to02go)02at02the02
very02hour,02the02very02minute02of02his02life02when02he02was02just02in02
the02very02mood02and02in02the02very02circumstances02in02which02that02
meeting02was02able02to02exert02the02gravest02and02most02decisive02

lying02in02wait02for02him02on02purpose!0202
It02was02about02nine02o'clock02when02he02crossed02the02Hay02
Market.02At02the02tables02and02the02barrows,02at02the02booths02and02
the02shops,02all02the02market02people02were02closing02their02
establishments02or02clearing02away02and02packing02up02their02
wares02and,02like02their02customers,02were02going02home.02Rag02
pickers02and02costermongers02of02all02kinds02were02crowding02
round02the02taverns02in02the02dirty02and02stinking02courtyards02of02
the02Hay02Market.02Raskolnikov02particularly02liked02this02place02
and02the02neighbouring02alleys,02when02he02wandered02aimlessly02
in02the02streets.02Here02his02rags02did02not02attract02contemptuous02
attention,02and02one02could02walk02about02in02any02attire02without02
scandalising02people.02At02the02corner02of02an02alley02a02huckster02
and02his02wife02had02two02tables02set02out02with02tapes,02thread,02
cotton02handkerchiefs,02etc.02They,02too,02had02got02up02to02go02
home,02but02were02lingering02in02conversation02with02a02friend,02
who02had02just02come02up02to02them.02This02friend02was02Lizaveta02
Ivanovna,02or,02as02everyone02called02her,02Lizaveta,02the02younger02
sister02of02the02old02pawnbroker,02Alyona02Ivanovna,02whom02
Raskolnikov02had02visited02the02previous02day02to02pawn02his02
watch02and02make02his02 experiment....02He02already02knew02all02
about02Lizaveta02and02she02knew02him02a02little02too.02She02was02a02
single02woman02of02about02thirty\five,02tall,02clumsy,02timid,02
submissive02and02almost02idiotic.02She02was02a02complete02slave02
and02went02in02fear02and02trembling02of02her02sister,02who02made02
her02work02day02and02night,02and02even02beat02her.02She02was02
standing02with02a02bundle02before02the02huckster02and02his02wife,02
listening02earnestly02and02doubtfully.02They02were02talking02of02
something02with02special02warmth.02The02moment02Raskolnikov02
caught02sight02of02her,02he02was02overcome02by02a02strange02
sensation02as02it02were02of02intense02astonishment,02though02there02
was02nothing02astonishing02about02this02meeting.0202
"You02could02make02up02your02mind02for02yourself,02Lizaveta02
Ivanovna,"02the02huckster02was02saying02aloud.02"Come02round02
to\morrow02about02seven.02They02will02be02here02too."0202
"To\morrow?"02said02Lizaveta02slowly02and02thoughtfully,02as02
though02unable02to02make02up02her02mind.0202
"Upon02my02word,02what02a02fright02you02are02in02of02Alyona02
Ivanovna,"02gabbled02the02huckster's02wife,02a02lively02little02
woman.02"I02look02at02you,02you02are02like02some02little02babe.02And02
she02is02not02your02own02sister02either\nothing02but02a02step\sister02
and02what02a02hand02she02keeps02over02you!"0202
"But02this02time02don't02say02a02word02to02Alyona02Ivanovna,"02
her02husband02interrupted;02"that's02my02advice,02but02come02
round02to02us02without02asking.02It02will02be02worth02your02while.02
Later02on02your02sister02herself02may02have02a02notion."0202
"Am02I02to02come?"0202
"About02seven02o'clock02to\morrow.02And02they02will02be02here.02
You02will02be02able02to02decide02for02yourself."0202
"And02we'll02have02a02cup02of02tea,"02added02his02wife.0202
"All02right,02I'll02come,"02said02Lizaveta,02still02pondering,02and02
she02began02slowly02moving02away.0202
Raskolnikov02had02just02passed02and02heard02no02more.02He02
passed02softly,02unnoticed,02trying02not02to02miss02a02word.02His02
first02amazement02was02followed02by02a02thrill02of02horror,02like02a02
shiver02running02down02his02spine.02He02had02learnt,02he02had02
suddenly02quite02unexpectedly02learnt,02that02the02next02day02at02
seven02o'clock02Lizaveta,02the02old02woman's02sister02and02only02
companion,02would02be02away02from02home02and02that02therefore02
at02seven02o'clock02precisely02the02old02woman02 would02 be02 left02
alone.0202He02was02only02a02few02steps02from02his02lodging.02He02went02in02
like02a02man02condemned02to02death.02He02thought02of02nothing02and02
was02incapable02of02thinking;02but02he02felt02suddenly02in02his02
whole02being02that02he02had02no02more02freedom02of02thought,02no02
will,02and02that02everything02was02suddenly02and02irrevocably02
decided.0202
Certainly,02if02he02had02to02wait02whole02years02for02a02suitable02
opportunity,02he02could02not02reckon02on02a02more02certain02step02
towards02the02success02of02the02plan02than02that02which02had02just02
presented02itself.02In02any02case,02it02would02have02been02difficult02to02
find02out02beforehand02and02with02certainty,02with02greater02
exactness02and02less02risk,02and02without02dangerous02inquiries02
and02investigations,02that02next02day02at02a02certain02time02an02old02
woman,02on02whose02life02an02attempt02was02contemplated,02

CHAPTER02VI0202
Later02on02Raskolnikov02happened02to02find02out02why02the02
huckster02and02his02wife02had02invited02Lizaveta.02It02was02a02very02
ordinary02matter02and02there02was02nothing02exceptional02about02
it.02A02family02who02had02come02to02the02town02and02been02reduced02to02
poverty02were02selling02their02household02goods02and02clothes,02all02
women's02things.02As02the02things02would02have02fetched02little02in02
the02market,02they02were02looking02for02a02dealer.02This02was02
Lizaveta's02business.02She02undertook02such02jobs02and02was02
frequently02employed,02as02she02was02very02honest02and02always02
fixed02a02fair02price02and02stuck02to02it.02She02spoke02as02a02rule02little02
and,02as02we02have02said02already,02she02was02very02submissive02and02
timid.0202But02Raskolnikov02had02become02superstitious02of02late.02The02
traces02of02superstition02remained02in02him02long02after,02and02
were02almost02ineradicable.02And02in02all02this02he02was02always02
afterwards02 disposed02 to02 see02 something02 strange02 and02
mysterious,02as02it02were,02the02presence02of02some02peculiar02
influences02and02coincidences.02In02the02previous02winter02a02
student02he02knew02called02Pokorev,02who02had02left02for02Harkov,02
had02chanced02in02conversation02to02give02him02the02address02of02
Alyona02Ivanovna,02the02old02pawnbroker,02in02case02he02might02
want02to02pawn02anything.02For02a02long02while02he02did02not02go02to02
her,02for02he02had02lessons02and02managed02to02get02along02
somehow.02Six02weeks02ago02he02had02remembered02the02address;02
he02had02two02articles02that02could02be02pawned:02his02father's02old02
silver02watch02and02a02little02gold02ring02with02three02red02stones,02a02
present02from02his02sister02at02parting.02He02decided02to02take02the02
ring.02When02he02found02the02old02woman02he02had02felt02an02
insurmountable02repulsion02for02her02at02the02first02glance,02
though02he02knew02nothing02special02about02her.02He02got02two02
roubles02from02her02and02went02into02a02miserable02little02tavern02on02
his02way02home.02He02asked02for02tea,02sat02down02and02sank02into02
deep02thought.02A02strange02idea02was02pecking02at02his02brain02like02
a02chicken02in02the02egg,02and02very,02very02much02absorbed02him.0202
Almost02beside02him02at02the02next02table02there02was02sitting02a02
student,02whom02he02did02not02know02and02had02never02seen,02and02
with02him02a02young02officer.02They02had02played02a02game02of02
billiards02and02began02drinking02tea.02All02at02once02he02heard02the02
student02mention02to02the02officer02the02pawnbroker02Alyona02
Ivanovna02and02give02him02her02address.02This02of02itself02seemed02
strange02to02Raskolnikov;02he02had02just02come02from02her02and02
here02at02once02he02heard02her02name.02Of02course02it02was02a02chance,02
but02 he02 could02 not02 shake02 off02 a02 very02 extraordinary02
impression,02and02here02someone02seemed02to02be02speaking02
expressly02for02him;02the02student02began02telling02his02friend02
various02details02about02Alyona02Ivanovna.0202
"She02is02first\rate,"02he02said.02"You02can02always02get02money02
from02her.02She02is02as02rich02as02a02Jew,02she02can02give02you02five02
thousand02roubles02at02a02time02and02she02is02not02above02taking02a02
pledge02for02a02rouble.02Lots02of02our02fellows02have02had02dealings02
with02her.02But02she02is02an02awful02old02harpy...."0202
And02he02began02describing02how02spiteful02and02uncertain02
she02was,02how02if02you02were02only02a02day02late02with02your02interest02
the02pledge02was02lost;02how02she02gave02a02quarter02of02the02value02of02
an02article02and02took02five02and02even02seven02percent02a02month02
on02it02and02so02on.02The02student02chattered02on,02saying02that02she02
had02a02sister02Lizaveta,02whom02the02wretched02little02creature02
was02continually02beating,02and02kept02in02complete02bondage02
like02a02small02child,02though02Lizaveta02was02at02least02six02feet02
high.0202"There's02a02phenomenon02for02you,"02cried02the02student02and02
he02laughed.0202
They02began02talking02about02Lizaveta.02The02student02spoke02
about02her02with02a02peculiar02relish02and02was02continually02
laughing02and02the02officer02listened02with02great02interest02and02
asked02him02to02send02Lizaveta02to02do02some02mending02for02him.02
Raskolnikov02did02not02miss02a02word02and02learned02everything02
about02her.02Lizaveta02was02younger02than02the02old02woman02and02
was02her02half\sister,02being02the02child02of02a02different02mother.02
She02was02thirty\five.02She02worked02day02and02night02for02her02
sister,02and02besides02doing02the02cooking02and02the02washing,02she02
did02sewing02and02worked02as02a02charwoman02and02gave02her02
sister02all02she02earned.02She02did02not02dare02to02accept02an02order02or02
job02of02any02kind02without02her02sister's02permission.02The02old02
woman02had02already02made02her02will,02and02Lizaveta02knew02of02it,02
and02by02this02will02she02would02not02get02a02farthing;02nothing02but02
the02movables,02chairs02and02so02on;02all02the02money02was02left02to02a02
monastery02in02the02province02of02N――,02that02prayers02might02be02
said02for02her02in02perpetuity.02Lizaveta02was02of02lower02rank02than02
her02sister,02unmarried02and02awfully02uncouth02in02appearance,02
remarkably02tall02with02long02feet02that02looked02as02if02they02were02
bent02outwards.02She02always02wore02battered02goatskin02shoes,02
and02was02clean02in02her02person.02What02the02student02expressed02
most02surprise02and02amusement02about02was02the02fact02that02
Lizaveta02was02continually02with02child.0202
"But02you02say02she02is02hideous?"02observed02the02officer.0202
"Yes,02she02is02so02dark\skinned02and02looks02like02a02soldier02
dressed02up,02but02you02know02she02is02not02at02all02hideous.02She02has02
such02a02good\natured02face02and02eyes.02Strikingly02so.02And02the02
proof02of02it02is02that02lots02of02people02are02attracted02by02her.02She02is02
such02a02soft,02gentle02creature,02ready02to02put02up02with02anything,02
always02willing,02willing02to02do02anything.02And02her02smile02is02
really02very02sweet."0202
"You02seem02to02find02her02attractive02yourself,"02laughed02the02
officer.0202
"From02her02queerness.02No,02I'll02tell02you02what.02I02could02kill02
that02damned02old02woman02and02make02off02with02her02money,02I02
assure02you,02without02the02faintest02conscience\prick,"02the02
student02added02with02warmth.02The02officer02laughed02again02
while02Raskolnikov02shuddered.02How02strange02it02was!0202
"Listen,02I02want02to02ask02you02a02serious02question,"02the02
student02said02hotly.02"I02was02joking02of02course,02but02look02here;02
on02one02side02we02have02a02stupid,02senseless,02worthless,02
spiteful,02ailing,02horrid02old02woman,02not02simply02useless02but02

case.02You02understand?02You02understand?"0202
"Yes,02yes,02I02understand,"02answered02the02officer,02watching02
his02excited02companion02attentively.0202
"Well,02listen02then.02On02the02other02side,02fresh02young02lives02

"Of02course02she02does02not02deserve02to02live,"02remarked02the02
officer,02"but02there02it02is,02it's02nature."0202
"Oh,02well,02brother,02but02we02have02to02correct02and02direct02

the02point02is,02what02do02we02mean02by02them.02Stay,02I02have02
another02question02to02ask02you.02Listen!"0202
"No,02you02stay,02I'll02ask02you02a02question.02Listen!"0202
"Well?"0202
"You02are02talking02and02speechifying02away,02but02tell02me,02
would02you02kill02the02old02woman02yourself?"0202
"Of02course02not!02I02was02only02arguing02the02justice02of02it....02It's02

"But02I02think,02if02you02would02not02do02it02yourself,02there's02no02
justice02about02it....02Let02us02have02another02game."0202
Raskolnikov02was02violently02agitated.02Of02course,02it02was02all02
ordinary02youthful02talk02and02thought,02such02as02he02had02often02
heard02before02in02different02forms02and02on02different02themes.02
But02why02had02he02happened02to02hear02such02a02discussion02and02
such02ideas02at02the02very02moment02when02his02own02brain02was02
just02conceiving...02the02very02same02ideas?02And02why,02just02at02the02
moment02when02he02had02brought02away02the02embryo02of02his02
idea02from02the02old02woman02had02he02dropped02at02once02upon02a02
conversation02about02her?02This02coincidence02always02seemed02
strange02to02him.02This02trivial02talk02in02a02tavern02had02an02
immense02influence02on02him02in02his02later02action;02as02though02
there02had02really02been02in02it02something02preordained,02some02
guiding02hint....0202
02
On02returning02from02the02Hay02Market02he02flung02himself02on02
the02sofa02and02sat02for02a02whole02hour02without02stirring.02
Meanwhile02it02got02dark;02he02had02no02candle02and,02indeed,02it02did02
not02occur02to02him02to02light02up.02He02could02never02recollect02
whether02he02had02been02thinking02about02anything02at02that02time.02
At02last02he02was02conscious02of02his02former02fever02and02shivering,02
and02he02realised02with02relief02that02he02could02lie02down02on02the02
sofa.02Soon02heavy,02leaden02sleep02came02over02him,02as02it02were02
crushing02him.0202
He02slept02an02extraordinarily02long02time02and02without02
dreaming.02Nastasya,02coming02into02his02room02at02ten02o'clock02
the02next02morning,02had02difficulty02in02rousing02him.02She02
brought02him02in02tea02and02bread.02The02tea02was02again02the02
second02brew02and02again02in02her02own02tea\pot.0202
"My02goodness,02how02he02sleeps!"02she02cried02indignantly.02
"And02he02is02always02asleep."0202
He02got02up02with02an02effort.02His02head02ached,02he02stood02up,02
took02a02turn02in02his02garret02and02sank02back02on02the02sofa02again.0202
"Going02to02sleep02again,"02cried02Nastasya.02"Are02you02ill,02eh?"0202
He02made02no02reply.0202
"Do02you02want02some02tea?"0202
"Afterwards,"02he02said02with02an02effort,02closing02his02eyes02
again02and02turning02to02the02wall.0202
Nastasya02stood02over02him.0202
"Perhaps02he02really02is02ill,"02she02said,02turned02and02went02out.02
She02came02in02again02at02two02o'clock02with02soup.02He02was02lying02
as02 before.02 The02 tea02 stood02 untouched.02 Nastasya02
felt02
positively02offended02and02began02wrathfully02rousing02him.0202
"Why02are02you02lying02like02a02log?"02she02shouted,02looking02at02
him02with02repulsion.0202
He02got02up,02and02sat02down02again,02but02said02nothing02and02
stared02at02the02floor.0202
"Are02you02ill02or02not?"02asked02Nastasya02and02again02received02
no02answer.02"You'd02better02go02out02and02get02a02breath02of02air,"02
she02said02after02a02pause.02"Will02you02eat02it02or02not?"0202
"Afterwards,"02he02said02weakly.02"You02can02go."0202
And02he02motioned02her02out.0202
She02remained02a02little02longer,02looked02at02him02with02
compassion02and02went02out.0202
A02few02minutes02afterwards,02he02raised02his02eyes02and02
looked02for02a02long02while02at02the02tea02and02the02soup.02Then02he02
took02the02bread,02took02up02a02spoon02and02began02to02eat.0202
He02ate02a02little,02three02or02four02spoonfuls,02without02appetite,02
as02it02were02mechanically.02His02head02ached02less.02After02his02meal02
he02stretched02himself02on02the02sofa02again,02but02now02he02could02
not02sleep;02he02lay02without02stirring,02with02his02face02in02the02
pillow.02He02was02haunted02by02day\dreams02and02such02strange02
day\dreams;02in02one,02that02kept02recurring,02he02fancied02that02he02
was02in02Africa,02in02Egypt,02in02some02sort02of02oasis.02The02caravan02
was02resting,02the02camels02were02peacefully02lying02down;02the02
palms02stood02all02around02in02a02complete02circle;02all02the02party02
were02at02dinner.02But02he02was02drinking02water02from02a02spring02
which02flowed02gurgling02close02by.02And02it02was02so02cool,02it02was02
wonderful,02wonderful,02blue,02cold02water02running02among02the02
parti\coloured02stones02and02over02the02clean02sand02which02
glistened02here02and02there02like02gold....02Suddenly02he02heard02a02
clock02strike.02He02started,02roused02himself,02raised02his02head,02
looked02out02of02the02window,02and02seeing02how02late02it02was,02
suddenly02jumped02up02wide02awake02as02though02someone02had02
pulled02him02off02the02sofa.02He02crept02on02tiptoe02to02the02door,02
stealthily02opened02it02and02began02listening02on02the02staircase.02
His02heart02beat02terribly.02But02all02was02quiet02on02the02stairs02as02if02
everyone02was02asleep....02It02seemed02to02him02strange02and02
monstrous02that02he02could02have02slept02in02such02forgetfulness02
from02the02previous02day02and02had02done02nothing,02had02
prepared02nothing02yet....02And02meanwhile02perhaps02it02had02
struck02six.02And02his02drowsiness02and02stupefaction02were02
followed02 by02 an02 extraordinary,02 feverish,02 as02
it02 were02
distracted02haste.02But02the02preparations02to02be02made02were02
few.02He02concentrated02all02his02energies02on02thinking02of02
everything02and02forgetting02nothing;02and02his02heart02kept02
beating02and02thumping02so02that02he02could02hardly02breathe.02
First02he02had02to02make02a02noose02and02sew02it02into02his02
overcoat―a02work02of02a02moment.02He02rummaged02under02his02
pillow02and02picked02out02amongst02the02linen02stuffed02away02
under02it,02a02worn02out,02old02unwashed02shirt.02From02its02rags02he02
tore02a02long02strip,02a02couple02of02inches02wide02and02about02sixteen02
inches02long.02He02folded02this02strip02in02two,02took02off02his02wide,02
strong02summer02overcoat02of02some02stout02cotton02material02
(his02only02outer02garment)02and02began02sewing02the02two02ends02
of02the02rag02on02the02inside,02under02the02left02armhole.02His02hands02
shook02as02he02sewed,02but02he02did02it02successfully02so02that02
nothing02showed02outside02when02he02put02the02coat02on02again.02
The02needle02and02thread02he02had02got02ready02long02before02and02
they02lay02on02his02table02in02a02piece02of02paper.02As02for02the02noose,02it02
was02a02very02ingenious02device02of02his02own;02the02noose02was02
intended02for02the02axe.02It02was02impossible02for02him02to02carry02the02
axe02through02the02street02in02his02hands.02And02if02hidden02under02
his02coat02he02would02still02have02had02to02support02it02with02his02
hand,02which02would02have02been02noticeable.02Now02he02had02only02
to02put02the02head02of02the02axe02in02the02noose,02and02it02would02hang02
quietly02under02his02arm02on02the02inside.02Putting02his02hand02in02his02
coat02pocket,02he02could02hold02the02end02of02the02handle02all02the02
way,02so02that02it02did02not02swing;02and02as02the02coat02was02very02full,02
a02regular02sack02in02fact,02it02could02not02be02seen02from02outside02
that02he02was02holding02something02with02the02hand02that02was02in02
the02pocket.02This02noose,02too,02he02had02designed02a02fortnight02
before.0202When02he02had02finished02with02this,02he02thrust02his02hand02into02
a02little02opening02between02his02sofa02and02the02floor,02fumbled02in02
the02left02corner02and02drew02out02the02pledge,02which02he02had02got02
ready02long02before02and02hidden02there.02This02pledge02was,02
however,02only02a02smoothly02planed02piece02of02wood02the02size02
and02thickness02of02a02silver02cigarette02case.02He02picked02up02this02
piece02of02wood02in02one02of02his02wanderings02in02a02courtyard02
where02there02was02some02sort02of02a02workshop.02Afterwards02he02
had02added02to02the02wood02a02thin02smooth02piece02of02iron,02which02
he02had02also02picked02up02at02the02same02time02in02the02street.02
Putting02the02iron02which02was02a02little02the02smaller02on02the02piece02
of02wood,02he02fastened02them02very02firmly,02crossing02and02re\
crossing02the02thread02round02them;02then02wrapped02them02
carefully02and02daintily02in02clean02white02paper02and02tied02up02the02
parcel02so02that02it02would02be02very02difficult02to02untie02it.02This02was02
in02order02to02divert02the02attention02of02the02old02woman02for02a02
time,02while02she02was02trying02to02undo02the02knot,02and02so02to02gain02
a02moment.02The02iron02strip02was02added02to02give02weight,02so02that02
the02woman02might02not02guess02the02first02minute02that02the02
"thing"02was02made02of02wood.02All02this02had02been02stored02by02him02
beforehand02under02the02sofa.02He02had02only02just02got02the02pledge02
out02when02he02heard02someone02suddenly02about02in02the02yard.0202
"It02struck02six02long02ago."0202
"Long02ago!02My02God!"0202
He02rushed02to02the02door,02listened,02caught02up02his02hat02and02
began02to02descend02his02thirteen02steps02cautiously,02noiselessly,02
like02a02cat.02He02had02still02the02most02important02thing02to02do―to02
steal02the02axe02from02the02kitchen.02That02the02deed02must02be02done02
with02an02axe02he02had02decided02long02ago.02He02had02also02a02pocket02
pruning\knife,02but02he02could02not02rely02on02the02knife02and02still02
less02on02his02own02strength,02and02so02resolved02finally02on02the02
axe.02We02may02note02in02passing,02one02peculiarity02in02regard02to02
all02the02final02resolutions02taken02by02him02in02the02matter;02they02
had02one02strange02characteristic:02the02more02final02they02were,02
the02more02hideous02and02the02more02absurd02they02at02once02
became02in02his02eyes.02In02spite02of02all02his02agonising02inward02
struggle,02he02never02for02a02single02instant02all02that02time02could02
believe02in02the02carrying02out02of02his02plans.0202
And,02indeed,02if02it02had02ever02happened02that02everything02to02
the02least02point02could02have02been02considered02and02finally02
settled,02and02no02uncertainty02of02any02kind02had02remained,02he02
would,02it02seems,02have02renounced02it02all02as02something02
absurd,02monstrous02and02impossible.02But02a02whole02mass02of02
unsettled02points02and02uncertainties02remained.02As02for02
getting02the02axe,02that02trifling02business02cost02him02no02anxiety,02
for02nothing02could02be02easier.02Nastasya02was02continually02out02
of02the02house,02especially02in02the02evenings;02she02would02run02in02
to02the02neighbours02or02to02a02shop,02and02always02left02the02door02
ajar.02It02was02the02one02thing02the02landlady02was02always02scolding02
her02about.02And02so,02when02the02time02came,02he02would02only02
have02to02go02quietly02into02the02kitchen02and02to02take02the02axe,02and02
an02hour02later02(when02everything02was02over)02go02in02and02put02it02
back02again.02But02these02were02doubtful02points.02Supposing02he02
returned02an02hour02later02to02put02it02back,02and02Nastasya02had02
come02back02and02was02on02the02spot.02He02would02of02course02have02
to02go02by02and02wait02till02she02went02out02again.02But02supposing02
she02were02in02the02meantime02to02miss02the02axe,02look02for02it,02make02
an02outcry―that02would02mean02suspicion02or02at02least02grounds02
for02suspicion.0202
But02those02were02all02trifles02which02he02had02not02even02begun02
to02consider,02and02indeed02he02had02no02time.02He02was02thinking02of02
the02chief02point,02and02put02off02trifling02details,02until02 he02could02
believe02in02it02all.02But02that02seemed02utterly02unattainable.02So02it02
seemed02to02himself02at02least.02He02could02not02imagine,02for02
instance,02that02he02would02sometime02leave02off02thinking,02get02up02
and02simply02go02there....02Even02his02late02experiment02(i.e.02his02
visit02with02the02object02of02a02final02survey02of02the02place)02was02
simply02an02attempt02at02an02experiment,02far02from02being02the02
real02thing,02as02though02one02should02say02"come,02let02us02go02and02
try02it―why02dream02about02it!"―and02at02once02he02had02broken02
down02and02had02run02away02cursing,02in02a02frenzy02with02himself.02
Meanwhile02it02would02seem,02as02regards02the02moral02question,02
that02his02analysis02was02complete;02his02casuistry02had02become02
keen02as02a02razor,02and02he02could02not02find02rational02objections02
in02himself.02But02in02the02last02resort02he02simply02ceased02to02
believe02
in02 himself,02 and02 doggedly,02 slavishly02 sought02
arguments02in02all02directions,02fumbling02for02them,02as02though02
someone02were02forcing02and02drawing02him02to02it.0202
At02first―long02before02indeed―he02had02been02much02
occupied02with02one02question;02why02almost02all02crimes02are02so02
badly02concealed02and02so02easily02detected,02and02why02almost02all02
criminals02
leave02such02obvious02traces?02He02had02come02
gradually02to02many02different02and02curious02conclusions,02and02
in02his02opinion02the02chief02reason02lay02not02so02much02in02the02
material02impossibility02of02concealing02the02crime,02as02in02the02
criminal02himself.02Almost02every02criminal02is02subject02to02a02
failure02of02will02and02reasoning02power02by02a02childish02and02
phenomenal02heedlessness,02at02the02very02instant02when02
prudence02and02caution02are02most02essential.02It02was02his02
conviction02that02this02eclipse02of02reason02and02failure02of02will02
power02attacked02a02man02like02a02disease,02developed02gradually02
and02reached02its02highest02point02just02before02the02perpetration02
of02the02crime,02continued02with02equal02violence02at02the02moment02
of02the02crime02and02for02longer02or02shorter02time02after,02according02
to02the02individual02case,02and02then02passed02off02like02any02other02
disease.02The02question02whether02the02disease02gives02rise02to02the02
crime,02or02whether02the02crime02from02its02own02peculiar02nature02
is02always02accompanied02by02something02of02the02nature02of02
disease,02he02did02not02yet02feel02able02to02decide.0202
When02he02reached02these02conclusions,02he02decided02that02in02
his02own02case02there02could02not02be02such02a02morbid02reaction,02
that02his02reason02and02will02would02remain02unimpaired02at02the02
time02of02carrying02out02his02design,02for02the02simple02reason02that02
his02design02was02"not02a02crime...."02We02will02omit02all02the02process02
by02means02of02which02he02arrived02at02this02last02conclusion;02we02
have02run02too02far02ahead02already....02We02may02add02only02that02the02
practical,02purely02material02difficulties02of02the02affair02occupied02
a02secondary02position02in02his02mind.02"One02has02but02to02keep02all02
one's02will\power02and02reason02to02deal02with02them,02and02they02
will02all02be02overcome02at02the02time02when02once02one02has02
familiarised02oneself02with02the02minutest02details02of02the02
business...."02But02this02preparation02had02never02been02begun.02
His02final02decisions02were02what02he02came02to02trust02least,02and02
when02the02hour02struck,02it02all02came02to02pass02quite02differently,02
as02it02were02accidentally02and02unexpectedly.0202
One02trifling02circumstance02upset02his02calculations,02before02
he02had02even02left02the02staircase.02When02he02reached02the02
landlady's02kitchen,02the02door02of02which02was02open02as02usual,02
he02glanced02cautiously02in02to02see02whether,02in02Nastasya's02
absence,02the02landlady02herself02was02there,02or02if02not,02whether02
the02door02to02her02own02room02was02closed,02so02that02she02might02
not02peep02out02when02he02went02in02for02the02axe.02But02what02was02
his02amazement02when02he02suddenly02saw02that02Nastasya02was02
not02only02at02home02in02the02kitchen,02but02was02occupied02there,02
taking02linen02out02of02a02basket02and02hanging02it02on02a02line.02Seeing02
him,02she02left02off02hanging02the02clothes,02turned02to02him02and02
stared02at02him02all02the02time02he02was02passing.02He02turned02away02
his02eyes,02and02walked02past02as02though02he02noticed02nothing.02
But02it02was02the02end02of02everything;02he02had02not02the02axe!02He02
was02overwhelmed.0202
"What02made02me02think,"02he02reflected,02as02he02went02under02
the02gateway,02"what02made02me02think02that02she02would02be02sure02
not02to02be02at02home02at02that02moment!02Why,02why,02why02did02I02
assume02this02so02certainly?"0202
He02was02crushed02and02even02humiliated.02He02could02have02
laughed02at02himself02in02his02anger....02A02dull02animal02rage02boiled02
within02him.0202
He02stood02hesitating02in02the02gateway.02To02go02into02the02
street,02to02go02a02walk02for02appearance'02sake02was02revolting;02to02
go02back02to02his02room,02even02more02revolting.02"And02what02a02
chance02I02have02lost02for02ever!"02he02muttered,02standing02
aimlessly02in02the02gateway,02just02opposite02the02porter's02little02
dark02room,02which02was02also02open.02Suddenly02he02started.02
From02the02porter's02room,02two02paces02away02from02him,02
something02shining02under02the02bench02to02the02right02caught02his02
eye....02He02looked02about02him―nobody.02He02approached02the02
room02on02tiptoe,02went02down02two02steps02into02it02and02in02a02faint02
voice02called02the02porter.02"Yes,02not02at02home!02Somewhere02
near02though,02in02the02yard,02for02the02door02is02wide02open."02He02
dashed02to02the02axe02(it02was02an02axe)02and02pulled02it02out02from02
under02the02bench,02where02it02lay02between02two02chunks02of02
wood;02at02once,02before02going02out,02he02made02it02fast02in02the02
noose,02he02thrust02both02hands02into02his02pockets02and02went02out02
of02the02room;02no02one02had02noticed02him!02"When02reason02fails,02
the02devil02helps!"02he02thought02with02a02strange02grin.02This02
chance02raised02his02spirits02extraordinarily.0202
He02walked02along02quietly02and02sedately,02without02hurry,02to02
avoid02awakening02suspicion.02He02scarcely02looked02at02the02
passers\by,02tried02to02escape02looking02at02their02faces02at02all,02and02
to02be02as02little02noticeable02as02possible.02Suddenly02he02thought02
of02his02hat.02"Good02heavens!02I02had02the02money02the02day02before02
yesterday02and02did02not02get02a02cap02to02wear02instead!"02A02curse02
rose02from02the02bottom02of02his02soul.0202
Glancing02out02of02the02corner02of02his02eye02into02a02shop,02he02saw02
by02a02clock02on02the02wall02that02it02was02ten02minutes02past02seven.02
He02had02to02make02haste02and02at02the02same02time02to02go02someway02
round,02so02as02to02approach02the02house02from02the02other02side....0202
When02he02had02happened02to02imagine02all02this02beforehand,02
he02had02sometimes02thought02that02he02would02be02very02much02
afraid.02But02he02was02not02very02much02afraid02now,02was02not02
afraid02at02all,02indeed.02His02mind02was02even02occupied02by02
irrelevant02matters,02but02by02nothing02for02long.02As02he02passed02
in02
the02 Yusupov02 garden,02 he02 was02 deeply02 absorbed02
considering02the02building02of02great02fountains,02and02of02their02
refreshing02effect02on02the02atmosphere02in02all02the02squares.02By02
degrees02he02passed02to02the02conviction02that02if02the02summer02
garden02were02extended02to02the02field02of02Mars,02and02perhaps02
joined02to02the02garden02of02the02Mihailovsky02Palace,02it02would02be02
a02splendid02thing02and02a02great02benefit02to02the02town.02Then02he02
was02interested02by02the02question02why02in02all02great02towns02men02
are02not02simply02driven02by02necessity,02but02in02some02peculiar02
way02inclined02to02live02in02those02parts02of02the02town02where02there02
are02no02gardens02nor02fountains;02where02there02is02most02dirt02and02
smell02and02all02sorts02of02nastiness.02Then02his02own02walks02
through02the02Hay02Market02came02back02to02his02mind,02and02for02a02
moment02he02waked02up02to02reality.02"What02nonsense!"02he02
thought,02"better02think02of02nothing02at02all!"0202
"So02probably02men02led02to02execution02clutch02mentally02at02
every02object02that02meets02them02on02the02way,"02flashed02through02
his02mind,02but02simply02flashed,02like02lightning;02he02made02haste02
to02dismiss02this02thought....02And02by02now02he02was02near;02here02
was02the02house,02here02was02the02gate.02Suddenly02a02clock02
somewhere02struck02once.02"What!02can02it02be02half\past02seven?02
Impossible,02it02must02be02fast!"0202
Luckily02for02him,02everything02went02well02again02at02the02gates.02
At02that02very02moment,02as02though02expressly02for02his02benefit,02a02
huge02waggon02of02hay02had02just02driven02in02at02the02gate,02
completely02screening02him02as02he02passed02under02the02gateway,02
and02the02waggon02had02scarcely02had02time02to02drive02through02
into02the02yard,02before02he02had02slipped02in02a02flash02to02the02right.02
On02the02other02side02of02the02waggon02he02could02hear02shouting02
and02quarrelling;02but02no02one02noticed02him02and02no02one02met02
him.02Many02windows02looking02into02that02huge02quadrangular02
yard02were02open02at02that02moment,02but02he02did02not02raise02his02
head―he02had02not02the02strength02to.02The02staircase02leading02to02
the02old02woman's02room02was02close02by,02just02on02the02right02of02the02
gateway.02He02was02already02on02the02stairs....0202
Drawing02a02breath,02pressing02his02hand02against02his02
throbbing02heart,02and02once02more02feeling02for02the02axe02and02
setting02
it02 straight,02 he02 began02 softly02 and02 cautiously02
ascending02the02stairs,02listening02every02minute.02But02the02stairs,02
too,02were02quite02deserted;02all02the02doors02were02shut;02he02met02
no02one.02One02flat02indeed02on02the02first02floor02was02wide02open02
and02painters02were02at02work02in02it,02but02they02did02not02glance02at02
him.02He02stood02still,02thought02a02minute02and02went02on.02"Of02
course02it02would02be02better02if02they02had02not02been02here,02but...02
it's02two02storeys02above02them."0202
And02there02was02the02fourth02storey,02here02was02the02door,02
here02was02the02flat02opposite,02the02empty02one.02The02flat02
underneath02the02old02woman's02was02apparently02empty02also;02
the02visiting02card02nailed02on02the02door02had02been02torn02off―
they02had02gone02away!...02He02was02out02of02breath.02For02one02
instant02the02thought02floated02through02his02mind02"Shall02I02go02
back?"02But02he02made02no02answer02and02began02listening02at02the02
old02woman's02door,02a02dead02silence.02Then02he02listened02again02
on02the02staircase,02listened02long02and02intently...02then02looked02
about02him02for02the02last02time,02pulled02himself02together,02drew02
himself02up,02and02once02more02tried02the02axe02in02the02noose.02"Am02I02
very02pale?"02he02wondered.02"Am02I02not02evidently02agitated?02
She02is02mistrustful....02Had02I02better02wait02a02little02longer...02till02
my02heart02leaves02off02thumping?"0202
But02his02heart02did02not02leave02off.02On02the02contrary,02as02
though02to02spite02him,02it02throbbed02more02and02more02violently.02
He02could02stand02it02no02longer,02he02slowly02put02out02his02hand02to02
the02bell02and02rang.02Half02a02minute02later02he02rang02again,02more02
loudly.0202No02answer.02To02go02on02ringing02was02useless02and02out02of02
place.02The02old02woman02was,02of02course,02at02home,02but02she02was02
suspicious02and02alone.02He02had02some02knowledge02of02her02
habits...02and02once02more02he02put02his02ear02to02the02door.02Either02
his02senses02were02peculiarly02keen02(which02it02is02difficult02to02
suppose),02or02the02sound02was02really02very02distinct.02Anyway,02
he02suddenly02heard02something02like02the02cautious02touch02of02a02
hand02on02the02lock02and02the02rustle02of02a02skirt02at02the02very02door.02
Someone02was02standing02stealthily02close02to02the02lock02and02just02
as02he02was02doing02on02the02outside02was02secretly02listening02
within,02and02seemed02to02have02her02ear02to02the02door....02He02
moved02a02little02on02purpose02and02muttered02something02aloud02
that02he02might02not02have02the02appearance02of02hiding,02then02rang02
a02third02time,02but02quietly,02soberly,02and02without02impatience,02
Recalling02it02afterwards,02that02moment02stood02out02in02his02mind02
vividly,02distinctly,02for02ever;02he02could02not02make02out02how02he02
had02had02such02cunning,02for02his02mind02was02as02it02were02clouded02
at02moments02and02he02was02almost02unconscious02of02his02body....02
An02instant02later02he02heard02the02latch02unfastened.0202
02
02
CHAPTER02VII0202
The02door02was02as02before02opened02a02tiny02crack,02and02again02
two02sharp02and02suspicious02eyes02stared02at02him02out02of02the02
darkness.02Then02Raskolnikov02lost02his02head02and02nearly02made02
a02great02mistake.0202
Fearing02the02old02woman02would02be02frightened02by02their02
being02alone,02and02not02hoping02that02the02sight02of02him02would02
disarm02her02suspicions,02he02took02hold02of02the02door02and02drew02
it02towards02him02to02prevent02the02old02woman02from02attempting02
to02shut02it02again.02Seeing02this02she02did02not02pull02the02door02back,02
but02she02did02not02let02go02the02handle02so02that02he02almost02dragged02
her02out02with02it02on02to02the02stairs.02Seeing02that02she02was02
standing02in02the02doorway02not02allowing02him02to02pass,02he02
advanced02straight02upon02her.02She02stepped02back02in02alarm,02
tried02to02say02something,02but02seemed02unable02to02speak02and02
stared02with02open02eyes02at02him.0202
"Good02evening,02Alyona02Ivanovna,"02he02began,02trying02to02
speak02easily,02but02his02voice02would02not02obey02him,02it02broke02
and02shook.02"I02have02come...02I02have02brought02something...02but02
we'd02better02come02in...02to02the02light...."0202
And02leaving02her,02he02passed02straight02into02the02room02
uninvited.02The02old02woman02ran02after02him;02her02tongue02was02
unloosed.0202
"Good02heavens!02What02it02is?02Who02is02it?02What02do02you02
want?"0202
"Why,02Alyona02Ivanovna,02you02know02me...02Raskolnikov...02
here,02I02brought02you02the02pledge02I02promised02the02other02day..."02
And02he02held02out02the02pledge.0202
The02old02woman02glanced02for02a02moment02at02the02pledge,02but02
at02once02stared02in02the02eyes02of02her02uninvited02visitor.02She02
looked02intently,02maliciously02and02mistrustfully.02A02minute02
passed;02he02even02fancied02something02like02a02sneer02in02her02eyes,02
as02though02she02had02already02guessed02everything.02He02felt02that02
he02was02losing02his02head,02that02he02was02almost02frightened,02so02
frightened02that02if02she02were02to02look02like02that02and02not02say02a02
word02for02another02half02minute,02he02thought02he02would02have02
run02away02from02her.0202
"Why02do02you02look02at02me02as02though02you02did02not02know02
me?"02he02said02suddenly,02also02with02malice.02"Take02it02if02you02
like,02if02not02I'll02go02elsewhere,02I02am02in02a02hurry."0202
He02had02not02even02thought02of02saying02this,02but02it02was02
suddenly02said02of02itself.02The02old02woman02recovered02herself,02
and02her02visitor's02resolute02tone02evidently02restored02her02
confidence.0202
"But02why,02my02good02sir,02all02of02a02minute....02What02is02it?"02she02
asked,02looking02at02the02pledge.0202
"The02silver02cigarette02case;02I02spoke02of02it02last02time,02you02
know."0202
She02held02out02her02hand.0202
"But02how02pale02you02are,02to02be02sure...02and02your02hands02are02
trembling02too?02Have02you02been02bathing,02or02what?"0202
"Fever,"02he02answered02abruptly.02"You02can't02help02getting02
pale...02if02you've02nothing02to02eat,"02he02added,02with02difficulty02
articulating02the02words.0202
His02strength02was02failing02him02again.02But02his02answer02
sounded02like02the02truth;02the02old02woman02took02the02pledge.0202
"What02
it?"02 she02 asked02 once02 more,02 scanning02
is02
Raskolnikov02intently,02and02weighing02the02pledge02in02her02hand.0202
"A02thing...02cigarette02case....02Silver....02Look02at02it."0202
"It02does02not02seem02somehow02like02silver....02How02he02has02
wrapped02it02up!"0202
Trying02to02untie02the02string02and02turning02to02the02window,02to02
the02light02(all02her02windows02were02shut,02in02spite02of02the02stifling02
heat),02she02left02him02altogether02for02some02seconds02and02stood02
with02her02back02to02him.02He02unbuttoned02his02coat02and02freed02the02
axe02from02the02noose,02but02did02not02yet02take02it02out02altogether,02
simply02holding02it02in02his02right02hand02under02the02coat.02His02
hands02were02fearfully02weak,02he02felt02them02every02moment02
growing02more02numb02and02more02wooden.02He02was02afraid02he02
would02let02the02axe02slip02and02fall....02A02sudden02giddiness02came02
over02him.0202
"But02what02has02he02tied02it02up02like02this02for?"02the02old02woman02
cried02with02vexation02and02moved02towards02him.0202
He02had02not02a02minute02more02to02lose.02He02pulled02the02axe02
quite02out,02swung02it02with02both02arms,02scarcely02conscious02of02
himself,02and02almost02without02effort,02almost02mechanically,02
brought02the02blunt02side02down02on02her02head.02He02seemed02not02
to02use02his02own02strength02in02this.02But02as02soon02as02he02had02once02
brought02the02axe02down,02his02strength02returned02to02him.0202
The02old02woman02was02as02always02bareheaded.02Her02thin,02
light02hair,02streaked02with02grey,02thickly02smeared02with02grease,02
was02plaited02in02a02rat's02tail02and02fastened02by02a02broken02horn02
comb02which02stood02out02on02the02nape02of02her02neck.02As02she02was02
so02short,02the02blow02fell02on02the02very02top02of02her02skull.02She02
cried02out,02but02very02faintly,02and02suddenly02sank02all02of02a02heap02
on02the02floor,02raising02her02hands02to02her02head.02In02one02hand02she02
still02held02"the02pledge."02Then02he02dealt02her02another02and02
another02blow02with02the02blunt02side02and02on02the02same02spot.02
The02blood02gushed02as02from02an02overturned02glass,02the02body02
fell02back.02He02stepped02back,02let02it02fall,02and02at02once02bent02over02
her02face;02she02was02dead.02Her02eyes02seemed02to02be02starting02out02
of02their02sockets,02the02brow02and02the02whole02face02were02drawn02
and02contorted02convulsively.0202
He02laid02the02axe02on02the02ground02near02the02dead02body02and02
felt02at02once02in02her02pocket02(trying02to02avoid02the02streaming02
body)―the02same02right\hand02pocket02from02which02she02had02
taken02the02key02on02his02last02visit.02He02was02in02full02possession02of02
his02faculties,02free02from02confusion02or02giddiness,02but02his02
hands02were02still02trembling.02He02remembered02afterwards02
that02he02had02been02particularly02collected02and02careful,02trying02
all02the02time02not02to02get02smeared02with02blood....02He02pulled02out02
the02keys02at02once,02they02were02all,02as02before,02in02one02bunch02on02
a02steel02ring.02He02ran02at02once02into02the02bedroom02with02them.02It02
was02a02very02small02room02with02a02whole02shrine02of02holy02images.02
Against02the02other02wall02stood02a02big02bed,02very02clean02and02
covered02with02a02silk02patchwork02wadded02quilt.02Against02a02
third02wall02was02a02chest02of02drawers.02Strange02to02say,02so02soon02
as02he02began02to02fit02the02keys02into02the02chest,02so02soon02as02he02
heard02their02jingling,02a02convulsive02shudder02passed02over02
him.02He02suddenly02felt02tempted02again02to02give02it02all02up02and02go02
away.02But02that02was02only02for02an02instant;02it02was02too02late02to02go02
back.02He02positively02smiled02at02himself,02when02suddenly02
another02terrifying02idea02occurred02to02his02mind.02He02suddenly02
fancied02that02the02old02woman02might02be02still02alive02and02might02
recover02her02senses.02Leaving02the02keys02in02the02chest,02he02ran02
back02to02the02body,02snatched02up02the02axe02and02lifted02it02once02
more02over02the02old02woman,02but02did02not02bring02it02down.02
There02was02no02doubt02that02she02was02dead.02Bending02down02and02
examining02her02again02more02closely,02he02saw02clearly02that02the02
skull02was02broken02and02even02battered02in02on02one02side.02He02was02
about02to02feel02it02with02his02finger,02but02drew02back02his02hand02and02
indeed02it02was02evident02without02that.02Meanwhile02there02was02a02
perfect02pool02of02blood.02All02at02once02he02noticed02a02string02on02her02
neck;02he02tugged02at02it,02but02the02string02was02strong02and02did02not02
snap02and02besides,02it02was02soaked02with02blood.02He02tried02to02
pull02it02out02from02the02front02of02the02dress,02but02something02held02
it02and02prevented02its02coming.02In02his02impatience02he02raised02
the02axe02again02to02cut02the02string02from02above02on02the02body,02but02
did02not02dare,02and02with02difficulty,02smearing02his02hand02and02
the02axe02in02the02blood,02after02two02minutes'02hurried02effort,02he02
cut02the02string02and02took02it02off02without02touching02the02body02
with02the02axe;02he02was02not02mistaken―it02was02a02purse.02On02the02
string02were02two02crosses,02one02of02Cyprus02wood02and02one02of02
copper,02and02an02image02in02silver02filigree,02and02with02them02a02
small02greasy02chamois02leather02purse02with02a02steel02rim02and02
ring.02The02purse02was02stuffed02very02full;02Raskolnikov02thrust02it02
in02his02pocket02without02looking02at02it,02flung02the02crosses02on02the02
old02woman's02body02and02rushed02back02into02the02bedroom,02this02
time02taking02the02axe02with02him.0202
He02was02in02terrible02haste,02he02snatched02the02keys,02and02
began02trying02them02again.02But02he02was02unsuccessful.02They02
would02not02fit02in02the02locks.02It02was02not02so02much02that02his02
hands02were02shaking,02but02that02he02kept02making02mistakes;02
though02he02saw02for02instance02that02a02key02was02not02the02right02
one02and02would02not02fit,02still02he02tried02to02put02it02in.02Suddenly02he02
remembered02and02realised02that02the02big02key02with02the02deep02
notches,02which02was02hanging02there02with02the02small02keys02
could02not02possibly02belong02to02the02chest02of02drawers02(on02his02
last02visit02this02had02struck02him),02but02to02some02strong02box,02and02
that02everything02perhaps02was02hidden02in02that02box.02He02left02the02
chest02of02drawers,02and02at02once02felt02under02the02bedstead,02
knowing02that02old02women02usually02keep02boxes02under02their02
beds.02And02so02it02was;02there02was02a02good\sized02box02under02the02
bed,02at02least02a02yard02in02length,02with02an02arched02lid02covered02
with02red02leather02and02studded02with02steel02nails.02The02notched02
key02fitted02at02once02and02unlocked02it.02At02the02top,02under02a02
white02sheet,02was02a02coat02of02red02brocade02lined02with02hareskin;02
under02it02was02a02silk02dress,02then02a02shawl02and02it02seemed02as02
though02there02was02nothing02below02but02clothes.02The02first02
thing02he02did02was02to02wipe02his02blood\stained02hands02on02the02
red02brocade.02"It's02red,02and02on02red02blood02will02be02less02
noticeable,"02the02thought02passed02through02his02mind;02then02he02
suddenly02came02to02himself.02"Good02God,02am02I02going02out02of02my02
senses?"02he02thought02with02terror.0202
But02no02sooner02did02he02touch02the02clothes02than02a02gold02
watch02slipped02from02under02the02fur02coat.02He02made02haste02to02
turn02them02all02over.02There02turned02out02to02be02various02articles02
made02of02gold02among02the02clothes―probably02all02pledges,02
unredeemed02 or02 waiting02 to02 be02 redeemed―bracelets,02
chains,02ear\rings,02pins02and02such02things.02Some02were02in02
cases,02others02simply02wrapped02in02newspaper,02carefully02and02
exactly02folded,02and02tied02round02with02tape.02Without02any02
delay,02he02began02filling02up02the02pockets02of02his02trousers02and02
overcoat02without02examining02or02undoing02the02parcels02and02
cases;02but02he02had02not02time02to02take02many....0202
He02suddenly02heard02steps02in02the02room02where02the02old02
woman02lay.02He02stopped02short02and02was02still02as02death.02But02all02
was02quiet,02so02it02must02have02been02his02fancy.02All02at02once02he02
heard02distinctly02a02faint02cry,02as02though02someone02had02uttered02
a02low02broken02moan.02Then02again02dead02silence02for02a02minute02
or02two.02He02sat02squatting02on02his02heels02by02the02box02and02waited02
holding02his02breath.02Suddenly02he02jumped02up,02seized02the02axe02
and02ran02out02of02the02bedroom.0202
In02the02middle02of02the02room02stood02Lizaveta02with02a02big02
bundle02in02her02arms.02She02was02gazing02in02stupefaction02at02her02
murdered02sister,02white02as02a02sheet02and02seeming02not02to02have02
the02strength02to02cry02out.02Seeing02him02run02out02of02the02bedroom,02
she02began02faintly02quivering02all02over,02like02a02leaf,02a02shudder02
ran02down02her02face;02she02lifted02her02hand,02opened02her02mouth,02
but02still02did02not02scream.02She02began02slowly02backing02away02
from02him02into02the02corner,02staring02intently,02persistently02at02
him,02but02still02uttered02no02sound,02as02though02she02could02not02get02
breath02to02scream.02He02rushed02at02her02with02the02axe;02her02
mouth02twitched02piteously,02as02one02sees02babies'02mouths,02
when02they02begin02to02be02frightened,02stare02intently02at02what02
frightens02them02and02are02on02the02point02of02screaming.02And02this02
hapless02 Lizaveta02 was02 so02 simple02 and02 had02 been02 so02
thoroughly02crushed02and02scared02that02she02did02not02even02raise02
a02hand02to02guard02her02face,02though02that02was02the02most02
necessary02and02natural02action02at02the02moment,02for02the02axe02
was02raised02over02her02face.02She02only02put02up02her02empty02left02
hand,02but02not02to02her02face,02slowly02holding02it02out02before02her02
as02though02motioning02him02away.02The02axe02fell02with02the02sharp02
edge02just02on02the02skull02and02split02at02one02blow02all02the02top02of02
the02head.02She02fell02heavily02at02once.02Raskolnikov02completely02
lost02his02head,02snatching02up02her02bundle,02dropped02it02again02
and02ran02into02the02entry.0202
Fear02 gained02 more02 and02 more02 mastery02 over02 him,02
especially02after02this02second,02quite02unexpected02murder.02He02
longed02to02run02away02from02the02place02as02fast02as02possible.02And02
if02at02that02moment02he02had02been02capable02of02seeing02and02
reasoning02more02correctly,02if02he02had02been02able02to02realise02all02
the02difficulties02of02his02position,02the02hopelessness,02the02
hideousness02and02the02absurdity02of02it,02if02he02could02have02
understood02how02many02obstacles02and,02perhaps,02crimes02he02
had02still02to02overcome02or02to02commit,02to02get02out02of02that02place02
and02to02make02his02way02home,02it02is02very02possible02that02he02
would02have02flung02up02everything,02and02would02have02gone02to02
give02himself02up,02and02not02from02fear,02but02from02simple02horror02
and02loathing02of02what02he02had02done.02The02feeling02of02loathing02
especially02surged02up02within02him02and02grew02stronger02every02
minute.02He02would02not02now02have02gone02to02the02box02or02even02
into02the02room02for02anything02in02the02world.0202
But02a02sort02of02blankness,02even02dreaminess,02had02begun02by02
degrees02to02take02possession02of02him;02at02moments02he02forgot02
himself,02or02rather,02forgot02what02was02of02importance,02and02
caught02at02trifles.02Glancing,02however,02into02the02kitchen02and02
seeing02a02bucket02half02full02of02water02on02a02bench,02he02bethought02
him02of02washing02his02hands02and02the02axe.02His02hands02were02
sticky02with02blood.02He02dropped02the02axe02with02the02blade02in02
the02water,02snatched02a02piece02of02soap02that02lay02in02a02broken02
saucer02on02the02window,02and02began02washing02his02hands02in02the02
bucket.02When02they02were02clean,02he02took02out02the02axe,02washed02
the02blade02and02spent02a02long02time,02about02three02minutes,02
washing02the02wood02where02there02were02spots02of02blood02
rubbing02them02with02soap.02Then02he02wiped02it02all02with02some02
linen02that02was02hanging02to02dry02on02a02line02in02the02kitchen02and02
then02he02was02a02long02while02attentively02examining02the02axe02at02
the02window.02There02was02no02trace02left02on02it,02only02the02wood02
was02still02damp.02He02carefully02hung02the02axe02in02the02noose02
under02his02coat.02Then02as02far02as02was02possible,02in02the02dim02light02
in02the02kitchen,02he02looked02over02his02overcoat,02his02trousers02
and02his02boots.02At02the02first02glance02there02seemed02to02be02
nothing02but02stains02on02the02boots.02He02wetted02the02rag02and02
rubbed02the02boots.02But02he02knew02he02was02not02looking02
thoroughly,02
there02 might02 be02 something02 quite02
noticeable02that02he02was02overlooking.02He02stood02in02the02middle02
of02the02room,02lost02in02thought.02Dark02agonising02ideas02rose02in02
his02mind―the02idea02that02he02was02mad02and02that02at02that02
moment02he02was02incapable02of02reasoning,02of02protecting02
himself,02that02he02ought02perhaps02to02be02doing02something02
utterly02different02from02what02he02was02now02doing.02"Good02
God!"02he02muttered02"I02must02fly,02fly,"02and02he02rushed02into02the02
entry.02But02here02a02shock02of02terror02awaited02him02such02as02he02
had02never02known02before.0202
He02stood02and02gazed02and02could02not02believe02his02eyes:02the02
door,02the02outer02door02from02the02stairs,02at02which02he02had02not02
long02before02waited02and02rung,02was02standing02unfastened02and02
at02least02six02inches02open.02No02lock,02no02bolt,02all02the02time,02all02
that02time!02The02old02woman02had02not02shut02it02after02him02
perhaps02as02a02precaution.02But,02good02God!02Why,02he02had02seen02
that02
Lizaveta02afterwards!02And02how02could02he,02how02could02he02have02
failed02to02reflect02that02she02must02have02come02in02somehow!02She02
could02not02have02come02through02the02wall!0202
He02dashed02to02the02door02and02fastened02the02latch.0202
"But02no,02the02wrong02thing02again!02I02must02get02away,02get02
away...."0202
He02unfastened02the02latch,02opened02the02door02and02began02
listening02on02the02staircase.0202
He02listened02a02long02time.02Somewhere02far02away,02it02might02
be02in02the02gateway,02two02voices02were02loudly02and02shrilly02
shouting,02quarrelling02and02scolding.02"What02are02they02about?"02
He02waited02patiently.02At02last02all02was02still,02as02though02
suddenly02cut02off;02they02had02separated.02He02was02meaning02to02
go02out,02but02suddenly,02on02the02floor02below,02a02door02was02noisily02
opened02and02someone02began02going02downstairs02humming02a02
tune.02"How02is02it02they02all02make02such02a02noise?"02flashed02
through02his02mind.02Once02more02he02closed02the02door02and02
waited.02At02last02all02was02still,02not02a02soul02stirring.02He02was02just02
taking02a02step02towards02the02stairs02when02he02heard02fresh02
footsteps.0202
The02steps02sounded02very02far02off,02at02the02very02bottom02of02
the02stairs,02but02he02remembered02quite02clearly02and02distinctly02
that02from02the02first02sound02he02began02for02some02reason02to02
suspect02that02this02was02someone02coming02there,02to02the02fourth02
floor,02to02the02old02woman.02Why?02Were02the02sounds02somehow02
peculiar,02significant?02The02steps02were02heavy,02even02and02
unhurried.02Now02he02had02passed02the02first02floor,02now02he02was02
mounting02higher,02it02was02growing02more02and02more02distinct!02
He02could02hear02his02heavy02breathing.02And02now02the02third02
storey02had02been02reached.02Coming02here!02And02it02seemed02to02
him02all02at02once02that02he02was02turned02to02stone,02that02it02was02like02
a02dream02in02which02one02is02being02pursued,02nearly02caught02and02
will02be02killed,02and02is02rooted02to02the02spot02and02cannot02even02
move02one's02arms.0202
At02last02when02the02unknown02was02mounting02to02the02fourth02
floor,02he02suddenly02started,02and02succeeded02in02slipping02
neatly02and02quickly02back02into02the02flat02and02closing02the02door02
behind02him.02Then02he02took02the02hook02and02softly,02noiselessly,02
fixed02it02in02the02catch.02Instinct02helped02him.02When02he02had02
done02this,02he02crouched02holding02his02breath,02by02the02door.02The02
unknown02visitor02was02by02now02also02at02the02door.02They02were02
now02standing02opposite02one02another,02as02he02had02just02before02
been02standing02with02the02old02woman,02when02the02door02divided02
them02and02he02was02listening.0202
The02visitor02panted02several02times.02"He02must02be02a02big,02fat02
man,"02thought02Raskolnikov,02squeezing02the02axe02in02his02hand.02
It02seemed02like02a02dream02indeed.02The02visitor02took02hold02of02the02
bell02and02rang02it02loudly.0202
As02soon02as02the02tin02bell02tinkled,02Raskolnikov02seemed02to02
be02aware02of02something02moving02in02the02room.02For02some02
seconds02he02listened02quite02seriously.02The02unknown02rang02
again,02 waited02 and02 suddenly02
tugged02 violently02 and02
impatiently02at02the02handle02of02the02door.02Raskolnikov02gazed02
in02horror02at02the02hook02shaking02in02its02fastening,02and02in02blank02
terror02expected02every02minute02that02the02fastening02would02be02
pulled02out.02It02certainly02did02seem02possible,02so02violently02was02
he02shaking02it.02He02was02tempted02to02hold02the02fastening,02but02he02
might02be02aware02of02it.02A02giddiness02came02over02him02again.02"I02
shall02fall02down!"02flashed02through02his02mind,02but02the02
unknown02began02to02speak02and02he02recovered02himself02at02
once.0202"What's02up?02Are02they02asleep02or02murdered?02D\damn02
them!"02he02bawled02in02a02thick02voice,02"Hey,02Alyona02Ivanovna,02
old02witch!02Lizaveta02Ivanovna,02hey,02my02beauty!02open02the02
door!02Oh,02damn02them!02Are02they02asleep02or02what?"0202
And02again,02enraged,02he02tugged02with02all02his02might02a02
dozen02times02at02the02bell.02He02must02certainly02be02a02man02of02
authority02and02an02intimate02acquaintance.0202
At02this02moment02light02hurried02steps02were02heard02not02far02
off,02 on02 the02 stairs.02 Someone02 else02 was02 approaching.02
Raskolnikov02had02not02heard02them02at02first.0202
"You02don't02say02there's02no02one02at02home,"02the02new\comer02
cried02in02a02cheerful,02ringing02voice,02addressing02the02first02
visitor,02who02still02went02on02pulling02the02bell.02"Good02evening,02
Koch."0202
"From02his02voice02he02must02be02quite02young,"02thought02
Raskolnikov.0202
"Who02the02devil02can02tell?02I've02almost02broken02the02lock,"02
answered02Koch.02"But02how02do02you02come02to02know02me?0202
"Why!02The02day02before02yesterday02I02beat02you02three02times02
running02at02billiards02at02Gambrinus'."0202
"Oh!"0202
"So02they02are02not02at02home?02That's02queer.02It's02awfully02
stupid02though.02Where02could02the02old02woman02have02gone?02
I've02come02on02business."0202
"Yes;02and02I02have02business02with02her,02too."0202
"Well,02what02can02we02do?02Go02back,02I02suppose,02Aie―aie!02
And02I02was02hoping02to02get02some02money!"02cried02the02young02
man.0202"We02must02give02it02up,02of02course,02but02what02did02she02fix02this02
time02for?02The02old02witch02fixed02the02time02for02me02to02come02
herself.02It's02out02of02my02way.02And02where02the02devil02she02can02
have02got02to,02I02can't02make02out.02She02sits02here02from02year's02end02
to02year's02end,02the02old02hag;02her02legs02are02bad02and02yet02here02all02
of02a02sudden02she02is02out02for02a02walk!"0202
"Hadn't02we02better02ask02the02porter?"0202
"What?"0202
"Where02she's02gone02and02when02she'll02be02back."0202
"Hm....02Damn02it02all!...02We02might02ask....02But02you02know02she02
never02does02go02anywhere."0202
And02he02once02more02tugged02at02the02door\handle.0202
"Damn02it02all.02There's02nothing02to02be02done,02we02must02go!"0202
"Stay!"02cried02the02young02man02suddenly.02"Do02you02see02how02
the02door02shakes02if02you02pull02it?"0202
"Well?"0202
"That02shows02it's02not02locked,02but02fastened02with02the02hook!02
Do02you02hear02how02the02hook02clanks?"0202
"Well?"0202
"Why,02don't02you02see?02That02proves02that02one02of02them02is02at02
home.02If02they02were02all02out,02they02would02have02locked02the02
door02from02the02outside02with02the02key02and02not02with02the02hook02
from02inside.02There,02do02you02hear02how02the02hook02is02clanking?02
To02fasten02the02hook02on02the02inside02they02must02be02at02home,02
don't02you02see.02So02there02they02are02sitting02inside02and02don't02
open02the02door!"0202
"Well!02And02so02they02must02be!"02cried02Koch,02astonished.02
"What02are02they02about02in02there?"02And02he02began02furiously02
shaking02the02door.0202
"Stay!"02cried02the02young02man02again.02"Don't02pull02at02it!02
There02must02be02something02wrong....02Here,02you've02been02
ringing02and02pulling02at02the02door02and02still02they02don't02open!02So02
either02they've02both02fainted02or..."0202
"What?"0202
"I02tell02you02what.02Let's02go02fetch02the02porter,02let02him02wake02
them02up."0202
"All02right."0202
Both02were02going02down.0202
"Stay.02You02stop02here02while02I02run02down02for02the02porter."0202
"What02for?"0202
"Well,02you'd02better."0202
"All02right."0202
"I'm02studying02the02law02you02see!02It's02evident,02e\vi\dent02
there's02something02wrong02here!"02the02young02man02cried02
hotly,02and02he02ran02downstairs.0202
Koch02remained.02Once02more02he02softly02touched02the02bell02
which02gave02one02tinkle,02then02gently,02as02though02reflecting02
and02looking02about02him,02began02touching02the02door\handle02
pulling02it02and02letting02it02go02to02make02sure02once02more02that02it02
was02only02fastened02by02the02hook.02Then02puffing02and02panting02
he02bent02down02and02began02looking02at02the02keyhole:02but02the02
key02was02in02the02lock02on02the02inside02and02so02nothing02could02be02
seen.0202Raskolnikov02stood02keeping02tight02hold02of02the02axe.02He02was02
in02a02sort02of02delirium.02He02was02even02making02ready02to02fight02
when02they02should02come02in.02While02they02were02knocking02and02
talking02together,02the02idea02several02times02occurred02to02him02to02
end02it02all02at02once02and02shout02to02them02through02the02door.02Now02
and02then02he02was02tempted02to02swear02at02them,02to02jeer02at02them,02
while02they02could02not02open02the02door!02"Only02make02haste!"02
was02the02thought02that02flashed02through02his02mind.0202
"But02what02the02devil02is02he02about?..."02Time02was02passing,02
one02minute,02and02another―no02one02came.02Koch02began02to02be02
restless.0202
"What02the02devil?"02he02cried02suddenly02and02in02impatience02
deserting02his02sentry02duty,02he,02too,02went02down,02hurrying02
and02thumping02with02his02heavy02boots02on02the02stairs.02The02steps02
died02away.0202
"Good02heavens!02What02am02I02to02do?"0202
Raskolnikov02unfastened02the02hook,02opened02the02door―
there02was02no02sound.02Abruptly,02without02any02thought02at02all,02
he02went02out,02closing02the02door02as02thoroughly02as02he02could,02
and02went02downstairs.0202
He02had02gone02down02three02flights02when02he02suddenly02
heard02a02loud02voice02below―where02could02he02go!02There02was02
nowhere02to02hide.02He02was02just02going02back02to02the02flat.0202
"Hey02there!02Catch02the02brute!"0202
Somebody02dashed02out02of02a02flat02below,02shouting,02and02
rather02fell02than02ran02down02the02stairs,02bawling02at02the02top02of02
his02voice.0202
"Mitka!02Mitka!02Mitka!02Mitka!02Mitka!02Blast02him!"0202
The02shout02ended02in02a02shriek;02the02last02sounds02came02from02
the02yard;02all02was02still.02But02at02the02same02instant02several02men02
talking02loud02and02fast02began02noisily02mounting02the02stairs.02
There02were02three02or02four02of02them.02He02distinguished02the02
ringing02voice02of02the02young02man.02"They!"0202
Filled02with02despair02he02went02straight02to02meet02them,02
feeling02"come02what02must!"02If02they02stopped02him―all02was02
lost;02if02they02let02him02pass―all02was02lost02too;02they02would02
remember02him.02They02were02approaching;02they02were02only02a02
flight02from02him―and02suddenly02deliverance!02A02few02steps02
from02him02on02the02right,02there02was02an02empty02flat02with02the02
door02wide02open,02the02flat02on02the02second02floor02where02the02
painters02had02been02at02work,02and02which,02as02though02for02his02
benefit,02they02had02just02left.02It02was02they,02no02doubt,02who02had02
just02run02down,02shouting.02The02floor02had02only02just02been02
painted,02in02the02middle02of02the02room02stood02a02pail02and02a02
broken02pot02with02paint02and02brushes.02In02one02instant02he02had02
whisked02in02at02the02open02door02and02hidden02behind02the02wall02
and02only02in02the02nick02of02time;02they02had02already02reached02the02
landing.02Then02they02turned02and02went02on02up02to02the02fourth02
floor,02talking02loudly.02He02waited,02went02out02on02tiptoe02and02ran02
down02the02stairs.0202
No02one02was02on02the02stairs,02nor02in02the02gateway.02He02passed02
quickly02through02the02gateway02and02turned02to02the02left02in02the02
street.0202
He02knew,02he02knew02perfectly02well02that02at02that02moment02
they02were02at02the02flat,02that02they02were02greatly02astonished02at02
finding02it02unlocked,02as02the02door02had02just02been02fastened,02
that02by02now02they02were02looking02at02the02bodies,02that02before02
another02 minute02 had02 passed02 they02 would02 guess02 and02
completely02realise02that02the02murderer02had02just02been02there,02
and02had02succeeded02in02hiding02somewhere,02slipping02by02them02
and02escaping.02They02would02guess02most02likely02that02he02had02
been02in02the02empty02flat,02while02they02were02going02upstairs.02And02
meanwhile02he02dared02not02quicken02his02pace02much,02though02
the02next02turning02was02still02nearly02a02hundred02yards02away.02
"Should02 he02 slip02
through02 some02 gateway02 and02 wait02
somewhere02in02an02unknown02street?02No,02hopeless!02Should02
he02fling02away02the02axe?02Should02he02take02a02cab?02Hopeless,02
hopeless!"0202
At02last02he02reached02the02turning.02He02turned02down02it02more02
dead02than02alive.02Here02he02was02half02way02to02safety,02and02he02
understood02it;02it02was02less02risky02because02there02was02a02great02
crowd02of02people,02and02he02was02lost02in02it02like02a02grain02of02sand.02
But02all02he02had02suffered02had02so02weakened02him02that02he02could02
scarcely02move.02Perspiration02ran02down02him02in02drops,02his02
neck02was02all02wet.02"My02word,02he02has02been02going02it!"02
someone02shouted02at02him02when02he02came02out02on02the02canal02
bank.0202He02was02only02dimly02conscious02of02himself02now,02and02the02
farther02he02went02the02worse02it02was.02He02remembered02
however,02that02on02coming02out02on02to02the02canal02bank,02he02was02
alarmed02at02finding02few02people02there02and02so02being02more02
conspicuous,02and02he02had02thought02of02turning02back.02Though02
he02was02almost02falling02from02fatigue,02he02went02a02long02way02
round02so02as02to02get02home02from02quite02a02different02direction.0202
He02was02not02fully02conscious02when02he02passed02through02the02
gateway02of02his02house!02he02was02already02on02the02staircase02
before02he02recollected02the02axe.02And02yet02he02had02a02very02grave02
problem02before02him,02to02put02it02back02and02to02escape02
observation02as02far02as02possible02in02doing02so.02He02was02of02
course02incapable02of02reflecting02that02it02might02perhaps02be02far02
better02not02to02restore02the02axe02at02all,02but02to02drop02it02later02on02in02
somebody's02yard.02But02it02all02happened02fortunately,02the02door02
of02the02porter's02room02was02closed02but02not02locked,02so02that02it02
seemed02most02likely02that02the02porter02was02at02home.02But02he02
had02so02completely02lost02all02power02of02reflection02that02he02
walked02straight02to02the02door02and02opened02it.02If02the02porter02
had02asked02him,02"What02do02you02want?"02he02would02perhaps02
have02simply02handed02him02the02axe.02But02again02the02porter02was02
not02at02home,02and02he02succeeded02in02putting02the02axe02back02
under02the02bench,02and02even02covering02it02with02the02chunk02of02
wood02as02before.02He02met02no02one,02not02a02soul,02afterwards02on02
the02way02to02his02room;02the02landlady's02door02was02shut.02When02
he02was02in02his02room,02he02flung02himself02on02the02sofa02just02as02he02
was―he02did02not02sleep,02but02sank02into02blank02forgetfulness.02If02
anyone02had02come02into02his02room02then,02he02would02have02
jumped02up02at02once02and02screamed.02Scraps02and02shreds02of02
thoughts02were02simply02swarming02in02his02brain,02but02he02could02
not02catch02at02one,02he02could02not02rest02on02one,02in02spite02of02all02his02

0202
So02he02lay02a02very02long02while.02Now02and02then02he02seemed02to02
wake02up,02and02at02such02moments02he02noticed02that02it02was02far02
into02the02night,02but02it02did02not02occur02to02him02to02get02up.02At02last02
he02noticed02that02it02was02beginning02to02get02light.02He02was02lying02
on02his02back,02still02dazed02from02his02recent02oblivion.02Fearful,02
despairing02cries02rose02shrilly02from02the02street,02sounds02which02
he02heard02every02night,02indeed,02under02his02window02after02two02
o'clock.02They02woke02him02up02now.0202
"Ah!02the02drunken02men02are02coming02out02of02the02taverns,"02
he02thought,02"it's02past02two02o'clock,"02and02at02once02he02leaped02
up,02as02though02someone02had02pulled02him02from02the02sofa.0202
"What!02Past02two02o'clock!"0202
He02sat02down02on02the02sofa―and02instantly02recollected02
everything!02All02at02once,02in02one02flash,02he02recollected02
everything.0202
For02the02first02moment02he02thought02he02was02going02mad.02A02
dreadful02chill02came02over02him;02but02the02chill02was02from02the02
fever02that02had02begun02long02before02in02his02sleep.02Now02he02was02
suddenly02taken02with02violent02shivering,02so02that02his02teeth02
chattered02and02all02his02limbs02were02shaking.02He02opened02the02
door02and02began02listening―everything02in02the02house02was02
asleep.02 With02 amazement02 he02 gazed02 at02 himself02 and02
everything02in02the02room02around02him,02wondering02how02he02
could02have02come02in02the02night02before02without02fastening02the02
door,02 and02 have02 flung02 himself02 on02 the02 sofa02 without02
undressing,02without02even02taking02his02hat02off.02It02had02fallen02off02
and02was02lying02on02the02floor02near02his02pillow.0202
"If02anyone02had02come02in,02what02would02he02have02thought?02
That02I'm02drunk02but..."0202
He02rushed02to02the02window.02There02was02light02enough,02and02
he02began02hurriedly02looking02himself02all02over02from02head02to02
foot,02all02his02clothes;02were02there02no02traces?02But02there02was02
no02doing02it02like02that;02shivering02with02cold,02he02began02taking02
looking02 over02 again.02 He02 turned02
off02 everything02 and02
everything02 over02to02the02
last02threads02and02rags,02and02
mistrusting02himself,02went02through02his02search02three02times.0202
But02there02seemed02to02be02nothing,02no02trace,02except02in02one02
place,02where02some02thick02drops02of02congealed02blood02were02
clinging02to02the02frayed02edge02of02his02trousers.02He02picked02up02a02
big02claspknife02and02cut02off02the02frayed02threads.02There02
seemed02to02be02nothing02more.0202
Suddenly02he02remembered02that02the02purse02and02the02things02
he02had02taken02out02of02the02old02woman's02box02were02still02in02his02
pockets!02He02had02not02thought02till02then02of02taking02them02out02
and02hiding02them!02He02had02not02even02thought02of02them02while02
he02was02examining02his02clothes!02What02next?02Instantly02he02
rushed02to02take02them02out02and02fling02them02on02the02table.02When02
he02had02pulled02out02everything,02and02turned02the02pocket02inside02
out02to02be02sure02there02was02nothing02left,02he02carried02the02whole02
heap02to02the02corner.02The02paper02had02come02off02the02bottom02of02
the02wall02and02hung02there02in02tatters.02He02began02stuffing02all02the02
things02into02the02hole02under02the02paper:02"They're02in!02All02out02of02
sight,02and02the02purse02too!"02he02thought02gleefully,02getting02up02
and02gazing02blankly02at02the02hole02which02bulged02out02more02than02
ever.02Suddenly02he02shuddered02all02over02with02horror;02"My02
God!"02he02whispered02in02despair:02"what's02the02matter02with02
me?02Is02that02hidden?02Is02that02the02way02to02hide02things?"0202
He02had02not02reckoned02on02having02trinkets02to02hide.02He02had02
only02thought02of02money,02and02so02had02not02prepared02a02hiding\
place.0202
"But02now,02now,02what02am02I02glad02of?"02he02thought,02"Is02that02
hiding02things?02My02reason's02deserting02me―simply!"0202
He02sat02down02on02the02sofa02in02exhaustion02and02was02at02once02
fit02 of02
shaken02 by02 another02 unbearable02
shivering.02
Mechanically02he02drew02from02a02chair02beside02him02his02old02
student's02winter02coat,02which02was02still02warm02though02almost02
in02rags,02covered02himself02up02with02it02and02once02more02sank02
into02drowsiness02and02delirium.02He02lost02consciousness.0202
Not02more02than02five02minutes02had02passed02when02he02
jumped02up02a02second02time,02and02at02once02pounced02in02a02frenzy02
on02his02clothes02again.0202
"How02could02I02go02to02sleep02again02with02nothing02done?02Yes,02
yes;02I02have02not02taken02the02loop02off02the02armhole!02I02forgot02it,02
forgot02a02thing02like02that!02Such02a02piece02of02evidence!"0202
He02pulled02off02the02noose,02hurriedly02cut02it02to02pieces02and02
threw02the02bits02among02his02linen02under02the02pillow.0202
"Pieces02of02torn02linen02couldn't02rouse02suspicion,02whatever02
happened;02I02think02not,02I02think02not,02any02way!"02he02repeated,02
standing02in02the02middle02of02the02room,02and02with02painful02
concentration02he02fell02to02gazing02about02him02again,02at02the02
floor02and02everywhere,02trying02to02make02sure02he02had02not02
forgotten02anything.02The02conviction02that02all02his02faculties,02
even02memory,02and02the02simplest02power02of02reflection02were02
failing02him,02began02to02be02an02insufferable02torture.0202
"Surely02it02isn't02beginning02already!02Surely02it02isn't02my02
punishment02coming02upon02me?02It02is!"0202
The02frayed02rags02he02had02cut02off02his02trousers02were02
actually02lying02on02the02floor02in02the02middle02of02the02room,02where02
anyone02coming02in02would02see02them!0202
"What02is02the02matter02with02me!"02he02cried02again,02like02one02
distraught.0202
Then02a02strange02idea02entered02his02head;02that,02perhaps,02all02
his02clothes02were02covered02with02blood,02that,02perhaps,02there02
were02a02great02many02stains,02but02that02he02did02not02see02them,02did02
not02notice02them02because02his02perceptions02were02failing,02were02
going02to02pieces...02his02reason02was02clouded....02Suddenly02he02
remembered02that02there02had02been02blood02on02the02purse02too.02
"Ah!02Then02there02must02be02blood02on02the02pocket02too,02for02I02put02
the02wet02purse02in02my02pocket!"0202
In02a02flash02he02had02turned02the02pocket02inside02out02and,02
yes!―there02were02traces,02stains02on02the02lining02of02the02pocket!0202
"So02my02reason02has02not02quite02deserted02me,02so02I02still02have02
some02sense02and02memory,02since02I02guessed02it02of02myself,"02he02
thought02triumphantly,02with02a02deep02sigh02of02relief;02"it's02
simply02the02weakness02of02fever,02a02moment's02delirium,"02and02
he02tore02the02whole02lining02out02of02the02left02pocket02of02his02
trousers.02At02that02instant02the02sunlight02fell02on02his02left02boot;02
on02the02sock02which02poked02out02from02the02boot,02he02fancied02
there02were02traces!02He02flung02off02his02boots;02"traces02indeed!02
The02tip02of02the02sock02was02soaked02with02blood;"02he02must02have02
unwarily02stepped02into02that02pool....02"But02what02am02I02to02do02
with02this02now?02Where02am02I02to02put02the02sock02and02rags02and02
pocket?"0202
He02gathered02them02all02up02in02his02hands02and02stood02in02the02
middle02of02the02room.0202
"In02the02stove?02But02they02would02ransack02the02stove02first02of02
all.02Burn02them?02But02what02can02I02burn02them02with?02There02are02
no02matches02even.02No,02better02go02out02and02throw02it02all02away02
somewhere.02Yes,02better02throw02it02away,"02he02repeated,02
sitting02down02on02the02sofa02again,02"and02at02once,02this02minute,02
without02lingering..."0202
But02his02head02sank02on02the02pillow02instead.02Again02the02
unbearable02icy02shivering02came02over02him;02again02he02drew02his02
coat02over02him.0202
And02for02a02long02while,02for02some02hours,02he02was02haunted02
by02the02impulse02to02"go02off02somewhere02at02once,02this02moment,02
and02fling02it02all02away,02so02that02it02may02be02out02of02sight02and02done02
with,02at02once,02at02once!"02Several02times02he02tried02to02rise02from02
the02sofa,02but02could02not.0202
He02was02thoroughly02waked02up02at02last02by02a02violent02
knocking02at02his02door.0202
"Open,02do,02are02you02dead02or02alive?02He02keeps02sleeping02
here!"02shouted02Nastasya,02banging02with02her02fist02on02the02door.02
"For02whole02days02together02he's02snoring02here02like02a02dog!02A02
dog02he02is02too.02Open02I02tell02you.02It's02past02ten."0202
"Maybe02he's02not02at02home,"02said02a02man's02voice.0202
"Ha!02that's02the02porter's02voice....02What02does02he02want?"0202
He02jumped02up02and02sat02on02the02sofa.02The02beating02of02his02
heart02was02a02positive02pain.0202
"Then02who02can02have02latched02the02door?"02retorted02
Nastasya.02"He's02taken02to02bolting02himself02in!02As02if02he02were02
worth02stealing!02Open,02you02stupid,02wake02up!"0202
"What02do02they02want?02Why02the02porter?02All's02discovered.02
Resist02or02open?02Come02what02may!..."0202
He02half02rose,02stooped02forward02and02unlatched02the02door.0202
His02room02was02so02small02that02he02could02undo02the02latch02
without02leaving02the02bed.02Yes;02the02porter02and02Nastasya02
were02standing02there.0202
Nastasya02stared02at02him02in02a02strange02way.02He02glanced02
with02a02defiant02and02desperate02air02at02the02porter,02who02without02
a02word02held02out02a02grey02folded02paper02sealed02with02bottle\
wax.0202"A02notice02from02the02office,"02he02announced,02as02he02gave02
him02the02paper.0202
"From02what02office?"0202
"A02summons02to02the02police02office,02of02course.02You02know02
which02office."0202
"To02the02police?...02What02for?..."0202
"How02can02I02tell?02You're02sent02for,02so02you02go."0202
The02man02looked02at02him02attentively,02looked02round02the02
room02and02turned02to02go02away.0202
"He's02downright02ill!"02observed02Nastasya,02not02taking02her02
eyes02off02him.02The02porter02turned02his02head02for02a02moment.02
"He's02been02in02a02fever02since02yesterday,"02she02added.0202
Raskolnikov02made02no02response02and02held02the02paper02in02
his02hands,02without02opening02it.02"Don't02you02get02up02then,"02
Nastasya02went02on02compassionately,02seeing02that02he02was02
letting02his02feet02down02from02the02sofa.02"You're02ill,02and02so02don't02
go;02there's02no02such02hurry.02What02have02you02got02there?"0202
He02looked;02in02his02right02hand02he02held02the02shreds02he02had02
cut02from02his02trousers,02the02sock,02and02the02rags02of02the02pocket.02
So02he02had02been02asleep02with02them02in02his02hand.02Afterwards02
reflecting02upon02it,02he02remembered02that02half02waking02up02in02
his02fever,02he02had02grasped02all02this02tightly02in02his02hand02and02so02
fallen02asleep02again.0202
"Look02at02the02rags02he's02collected02and02sleeps02with02them,02
as02though02he02has02got02hold02of02a02treasure..."0202
And02Nastasya02went02off02into02her02hysterical02giggle.0202
Instantly02he02thrust02them02all02under02his02great02coat02and02
fixed02his02eyes02intently02upon02her.02Far02as02he02was02from02being02
capable02of02rational02reflection02at02that02moment,02he02felt02that02
no02one02would02behave02like02that02with02a02person02who02was02
going02to02be02arrested.02"But...02the02police?"0202
"You'd02better02have02some02tea!02Yes?02I'll02bring02it,02there's02
some02left."0202
"No...02I'm02going;02I'll02go02at02once,"02he02muttered,02getting02on02
to02his02feet.0202
"Why,02you'll02never02get02downstairs!"0202
"Yes,02I'll02go."0202
"As02you02please."0202
She02followed02the02porter02out.0202
At02once02he02rushed02to02the02light02to02examine02the02sock02and02
the02rags.0202
"There02are02stains,02but02not02very02noticeable;02all02covered02
with02dirt,02and02rubbed02and02already02discoloured.02No02one02
who02 had02 no02 suspicion02 could02 distinguish02 anything.02
Nastasya02from02a02distance02could02not02have02noticed,02thank02
God!"02Then02with02a02tremor02he02broke02the02seal02of02the02notice02
and02began02reading;02he02was02a02long02while02reading,02before02he02
understood.02It02was02an02ordinary02summons02from02the02district02
police\station02to02appear02that02day02at02half\past02nine02at02the02
office02of02the02district02superintendent.0202
"But02when02has02such02a02thing02happened?02I02never02have02
anything02to02do02with02the02police!02And02why02just02to\day?"02he02
thought02in02agonising02bewilderment.02"Good02God,02only02get02it02
over02soon!"0202
He02was02flinging02himself02on02his02knees02to02pray,02but02broke02
into02laughter―not02at02the02idea02of02prayer,02but02at02himself.0202
He02began,02hurriedly02dressing.02"If02I'm02lost,02I02am02lost,02I02
don't02care!02Shall02I02put02the02sock02on?"02he02suddenly02
wondered,02"it02will02get02dustier02still02and02the02traces02will02be02
gone."0202But02no02sooner02had02he02put02it02on02than02he02pulled02it02off02
again02in02loathing02and02horror.02He02pulled02it02off,02but02reflecting02
that02he02had02no02other02socks,02he02picked02it02up02and02put02it02on02
again―and02again02he02laughed.0202
"That's02all02conventional,02that's02all02relative,02merely02a02way02
of02looking02at02it,"02he02thought02in02a02flash,02but02only02on02the02top02
surface02of02his02mind,02while02he02was02shuddering02all02over,02
"there,02I've02got02it02on!02I02have02finished02by02getting02it02on!"0202
But02his02laughter02was02quickly02followed02by02despair.0202
"No,02it's02too02much02for02me..."02he02thought.02His02legs02shook.02
"From02fear,"02he02muttered.02His02head02swam02and02ached02with02
fever.02"It's02a02trick!02They02want02to02decoy02me02there02and02
confound02me02over02everything,"02he02mused,02as02he02went02out02
on02to02the02stairs―"the02worst02of02it02is02I'm02almost02light\
headed...02I02may02blurt02out02something02stupid..."0202
On02the02stairs02he02remembered02that02he02was02leaving02all02the02
things02just02as02they02were02in02the02hole02in02the02wall,02"and02very02
likely,02it's02on02purpose02to02search02when02I'm02out,"02he02thought,02
and02stopped02short.02But02he02was02possessed02by02such02despair,02
such02cynicism02of02misery,02if02one02may02so02call02it,02that02with02a02
wave02of02his02hand02he02went02on.02"Only02to02get02it02over!"0202
In02the02street02the02heat02was02insufferable02again;02not02a02drop02
of02rain02had02fallen02all02those02days.02Again02dust,02bricks02and02
mortar,02again02the02stench02from02the02shops02and02pot\houses,02
again02the02drunken02men,02the02Finnish02pedlars02and02half\
broken\down02cabs.02The02sun02shone02straight02in02his02eyes,02so02
that02it02hurt02him02to02look02out02of02them,02and02he02felt02his02head02
going02round―as02a02man02in02a02fever02is02apt02to02feel02when02he02
comes02out02into02the02street02on02a02bright02sunny02day.0202
When02he02reached02the02turning02into02 the02street,02in02an02
agony02of02trepidation02he02looked02down02it...02at02the02house...02and02
at02once02averted02his02eyes.0202
"If02they02question02me,02perhaps02I'll02simply02tell,"02he02
thought,02as02he02drew02near02the02police\station.0202
The02police\station02was02about02a02quarter02of02a02mile02off.02It02
had02lately02been02moved02to02new02rooms02on02the02fourth02floor02of02
a02new02house.02He02had02been02once02for02a02moment02in02the02old02
office02but02long02ago.02Turning02in02at02the02gateway,02he02saw02on02
the02right02a02flight02of02stairs02which02a02peasant02was02mounting02
with02a02book02in02his02hand.02"A02house\porter,02no02doubt;02so02
then,02the02office02is02here,"02and02he02began02ascending02the02stairs02
on02the02chance.02He02did02not02want02to02ask02questions02of02anyone.0202
"I'll02go02in,02fall02on02my02knees,02and02confess02everything..."02he02
thought,02as02he02reached02the02fourth02floor.0202
The02staircase02was02steep,02narrow02and02all02sloppy02with02
dirty02water.02The02kitchens02of02the02flats02opened02on02to02the02
stairs02and02stood02open02almost02the02whole02day.02So02there02was02a02
fearful02smell02and02heat.02The02staircase02was02crowded02with02
porters02going02up02and02down02with02their02books02under02their02
arms,02policemen,02and02persons02of02all02sorts02and02both02sexes.02
The02door02of02the02office,02too,02stood02wide02open.02Peasants02
stood02waiting02within.02There,02too,02the02heat02was02stifling02and02
there02was02a02sickening02smell02of02fresh02paint02and02stale02oil02
from02the02newly02decorated02rooms.0202
After02waiting02a02little,02he02decided02to02move02forward02into02
the02next02room.02All02the02rooms02were02small02and02low\pitched.02
A02fearful02impatience02drew02him02on02and02on.02No02one02paid02
attention02to02him.02In02the02second02room02some02clerks02sat02
writing,02dressed02hardly02better02than02he02was,02and02rather02a02
queer\looking02set.02He02went02up02to02one02of02them.0202
"What02is02it?"0202
He02showed02the02notice02he02had02received.0202
"You02are02a02student?"02the02man02asked,02glancing02at02the02
notice.0202
"Yes,02formerly02a02student."0202
The02clerk02looked02at02him,02but02without02the02slightest02
interest.02He02was02a02particularly02unkempt02person02with02the02
look02of02a02fixed02idea02in02his02eye.0202
"There02would02be02no02getting02anything02out02of02him,02
because02 he02 has02 no02
interest02
in02 anything,"02 thought02
Raskolnikov.0202
"Go02in02there02to02the02head02clerk,"02said02the02clerk,02pointing02
towards02the02furthest02room.0202
He02went02into02that02room―the02fourth02in02order;02it02was02a02
small02room02and02packed02full02of02people,02rather02better02
dressed02than02in02the02outer02rooms.02Among02them02were02two02
ladies.02One,02poorly02dressed02in02mourning,02sat02at02the02table02
opposite02the02chief02clerk,02writing02something02at02his02dictation.02
The02other,02a02very02stout,02buxom02woman02with02a02purplish\
red,02blotchy02face,02excessively02smartly02dressed02with02a02
brooch02on02her02bosom02as02big02as02a02saucer,02was02standing02on02
one02side,02apparently02waiting02for02something.02Raskolnikov02
thrust02his02notice02upon02the02head02clerk.02The02latter02glanced02at02
it,02said:02"Wait02a02minute,"02and02went02on02attending02to02the02lady02
in02mourning.0202
He02breathed02more02freely.02"It02can't02be02that!"0202
By02degrees02he02began02to02regain02confidence,02he02kept02
urging02himself02to02have02courage02and02be02calm.0202
"Some02foolishness,02some02trifling02carelessness,02and02I02
may02betray02myself!02Hm...02it's02a02pity02there's02no02air02here,"02he02
added,02"it's02stifling....02It02makes02one's02head02dizzier02than02
ever...02and02one's02mind02too..."0202
He02was02conscious02of02a02terrible02inner02turmoil.02He02was02
afraid02of02losing02his02self\control;02he02tried02to02catch02at02
something02and02fix02his02mind02on02it,02something02quite02
irrelevant,02but02he02could02not02succeed02in02this02at02all.02Yet02the02
head02clerk02greatly02interested02him,02he02kept02hoping02to02see02
through02him02and02guess02something02from02his02face.0202
He02was02a02very02young02man,02about02two02and02twenty,02with02
a02dark02mobile02face02that02looked02older02than02his02years.02He02was02
fashionably02dressed02and02foppish,02with02his02hair02parted02in02
the02middle,02well02combed02and02pomaded,02and02wore02a02
number02of02rings02on02his02well\scrubbed02fingers02and02a02gold02
chain02on02his02waistcoat.02He02said02a02couple02of02words02in02French02
to02a02foreigner02who02was02in02the02room,02and02said02them02fairly02
correctly.0202
"Luise02Ivanovna,02you02can02sit02down,"02he02said02casually02to02
the02 gaily\dressed,02 purple\faced02
lady,02 who02 was02 still02
standing02as02though02not02venturing02to02sit02down,02though02
there02was02a02chair02beside02her.0202
"Ich02danke,"02said02the02latter,02and02softly,02with02a02rustle02of02
silk02she02sank02into02the02chair.02Her02light02blue02dress02trimmed02
with02white02lace02floated02about02the02table02like02an02air\balloon02
and02filled02almost02half02the02room.02She02smelt02of02scent.02But02she02
was02obviously02embarrassed02at02filling02half02the02room02and02
smelling02so02strongly02of02scent;02and02though02her02smile02was02
impudent02 as02 well02 as02 cringing,02
it02 betrayed02 evident02
uneasiness.0202
The02lady02in02mourning02had02done02at02last,02and02got02up.02All02at02
once,02with02some02noise,02an02officer02walked02in02very02jauntily,02
with02a02peculiar02swing02of02his02shoulders02at02each02step.02He02
tossed02his02cockaded02cap02on02the02table02and02sat02down02in02an02
easy\chair.02The02small02lady02positively02skipped02from02her02seat02
on02seeing02him,02and02fell02to02curtsying02in02a02sort02of02ecstasy;02but02
the02officer02took02not02the02smallest02notice02of02her,02and02she02did02
not02venture02to02sit02down02again02in02his02presence.02He02was02the02
assistant02superintendent.02He02had02a02reddish02moustache02that02
stood02out02horizontally02on02each02side02of02his02face,02and02
extremely02small02features,02expressive02of02nothing02much02
except02a02certain02insolence.02He02looked02askance02and02rather02
indignantly02at02Raskolnikov;02he02was02so02very02badly02dressed,02
and02in02spite02of02his02humiliating02position,02his02bearing02was02by02
no02means02in02keeping02with02his02clothes.02Raskolnikov02had02
unwarily02fixed02a02very02long02and02direct02look02on02him,02so02that02
he02felt02positively02affronted.0202
"What02 do02 you02 want?"02 he02 shouted,02 apparently02
astonished02that02such02a02ragged02fellow02was02not02annihilated02
by02the02majesty02of02his02glance.0202
"I02was02summoned...02by02a02notice..."02Raskolnikov02faltered.0202
"For02the02recovery02of02money02due,02from02the02student,"02the02
head02clerk02interfered02hurriedly,02tearing02himself02from02his02
papers.02"Here!"02and02he02flung02Raskolnikov02a02document02and02
pointed02out02the02place.02"Read02that!"0202
"Money?02What02money?"02thought02Raskolnikov,02"but...02
then...02it's02certainly02not02that."0202
And02he02trembled02with02joy.02He02felt02sudden02intense02
indescribable02relief.02A02load02was02lifted02from02his02back.0202
"And02pray,02what02time02were02you02directed02to02appear,02sir?"02
shouted02the02assistant02superintendent,02seeming02for02some02
unknown02reason02more02and02more02aggrieved.02"You02are02told02
to02come02at02nine,02and02now02it's02twelve!"0202
"The02notice02was02only02brought02me02a02quarter02of02an02hour02
ago,"02Raskolnikov02answered02loudly02over02his02shoulder.02To02
his02own02surprise02he,02too,02grew02suddenly02angry02and02found02a02
certain02pleasure02in02it.02"And02it's02enough02that02I02have02come02
here02ill02with02fever."0202
"Kindly02refrain02from02shouting!"0202
"I'm02not02shouting,02I'm02speaking02very02quietly,02it's02you02
who02are02shouting02at02me.02I'm02a02student,02and02allow02no02one02to02
shout02at02me."0202
The02assistant02superintendent02was02so02furious02that02for02
the02first02minute02he02could02only02splutter02inarticulately.02He02
leaped02up02from02his02seat.0202
"Be02silent!02You02are02in02a02government02office.02Don't02be02
impudent,02sir!"0202
"You're02in02a02government02office,02too,"02cried02Raskolnikov,02
"and02you're02smoking02a02cigarette02as02well02as02shouting,02so02you02
are02showing02disrespect02to02all02of02us."0202
He02felt02an02indescribable02satisfaction02at02having02said02this.0202
The02head02clerk02looked02at02him02with02a02smile.02The02angry02
assistant02superintendent02was02obviously02disconcerted.0202
"Kindly02 make02
"That's02not02your02business!"02he02shouted02at02last02with02
unnatural02
the02 declaration02
loudness.02
demanded02of02you.02Show02him.02Alexandr02Grigorievitch.02
There02is02a02complaint02against02you!02You02don't02pay02your02
debts!02You're02a02fine02bird!"0202
But02Raskolnikov02was02not02listening02now;02he02had02eagerly02
clutched02at02the02paper,02in02haste02to02find02an02explanation.02He02
read02it02once,02and02a02second02time,02and02still02did02not02
understand.0202
"What02is02this?"02he02asked02the02head02clerk.0202
"It02is02for02the02recovery02of02money02on02an02I02O02U,02a02writ.02You02
must02either02pay02it,02with02all02expenses,02costs02and02so02on,02or02
give02a02written02declaration02when02you02can02pay02it,02and02at02the02
same02time02an02undertaking02not02to02leave02the02capital02without02

listened,02he02
answered,02he02even02asked02questions02himself,02but02all02
mechanically.02 The02 triumphant02 sense02 of02 security,02 of02

fuming02 and02 obviously02
Raskolnikov's02 disrespect,02 still02
anxious02to02keep02up02his02wounded02dignity,02pounced02on02the02
unfortunate02smart02lady,02who02had02been02gazing02at02him02ever02

"You02shameful02hussy!"02he02shouted02suddenly02at02the02top02
of02his02voice.02(The02lady02in02mourning02had02left02the02office.)02
"What02was02going02on02at02your02house02last02night?02Eh!02A02

looked02 wildly02 at02

unceremoniously02treated.02But02he02soon02saw02what02it02meant,02

"Write!"02said02the02head02clerk02to02Raskolnikov.0202
"Write02what?"02the02latter02asked,02gruffly.0202
"I02will02dictate02to02you."0202
Raskolnikov02fancied02that02the02head02clerk02treated02him02
more02casually02and02contemptuously02after02his02speech,02but02
strange02to02say02he02suddenly02felt02completely02indifferent02to02
anyone's02opinion,02and02this02revulsion02took02place02in02a02flash,02
in02one02instant.02If02he02had02cared02to02think02a02little,02he02would02

them02like02that02a02minute02before,02forcing02his02feelings02upon02
them.02And02where02had02those02feelings02come02from?02Now02if02the02

with02those02nearest02and02dearest02to02him,02he02would02not02have02

A02gloomy02sensation02of02agonising,02everlasting02solitude02and02

Ilya02
Petrovitch,02nor02the02meanness02of02the02latter's02triumph02over02

appeal02to02them02in02any02circumstance02of02life.02He02had02never02
experienced02such02a02strange02and02awful02sensation.02And02what02
was02most02agonising―it02was02more02a02sensation02than02a02
conception02or02idea,02a02direct02sensation,02the02most02agonising02
of02all02the02sensations02he02had02known02in02his02life.0202
The02head02clerk02began02dictating02to02him02the02usual02form02of02
declaration,02that02he02could02not02pay,02that02he02undertook02to02do02
so02at02a02future02date,02that02he02would02not02leave02the02town,02nor02
sell02his02property,02and02so02on.0202
"But02you02can't02write,02you02can02hardly02hold02the02pen,"02
observed02 the02 head02 clerk,02
looking02 with02 curiosity02 at02
Raskolnikov.02"Are02you02ill?"0202
"Yes,02I02am02giddy.02Go02on!"0202
"That's02all.02Sign02it."0202
The02head02clerk02took02the02paper,02and02turned02to02attend02to02
others.0202
Raskolnikov02gave02back02the02pen;02but02instead02of02getting02
up02and02going02away,02he02put02his02elbows02on02the02table02and02
pressed02his02head02in02his02hands.02He02felt02as02if02a02nail02were02
being02driven02into02his02skull.02A02strange02idea02suddenly02
occurred02to02him,02to02get02up02at02once,02to02go02up02to02Nikodim02
Fomitch,02and02tell02him02everything02that02had02happened02
yesterday,02and02then02to02go02with02him02to02his02lodgings02and02to02
show02him02the02things02in02the02hole02in02the02corner.02The02impulse02
was02so02strong02that02he02got02up02from02his02seat02to02carry02it02out.02
"Hadn't02I02better02think02a02minute?"02flashed02through02his02mind.02
"No,02better02cast02off02the02burden02without02thinking."02But02all02at02
once02he02stood02still,02rooted02to02the02spot.02Nikodim02Fomitch02
was02talking02eagerly02with02Ilya02Petrovitch,02and02the02words02
reached02him:0202
"It's02impossible,02they'll02both02be02released.02To02begin02with,02
the02whole02story02contradicts02itself.02Why02should02they02have02
called02the02porter,02if02it02had02been02their02doing?02To02inform02
against02themselves?02Or02as02a02blind?02No,02that02would02be02too02
cunning!02Besides,02Pestryakov,02the02student,02was02seen02at02the02
gate02by02both02the02porters02and02a02woman02as02he02went02in.02He02
was02walking02with02three02friends,02who02left02him02only02at02the02
gate,02and02he02asked02the02porters02to02direct02him,02in02the02
presence02of02the02friends.02Now,02would02he02have02asked02his02way02
if02he02had02been02going02with02such02an02object?02As02for02Koch,02he02
spent02half02an02hour02at02the02silversmith's02below,02before02he02
went02up02to02the02old02woman02and02he02left02him02at02exactly02a02
quarter02to02eight.02Now02just02consider..."0202
"But02excuse02me,02how02do02you02explain02this02contradiction?02
They02state02themselves02that02they02knocked02and02the02door02was02
locked;02yet02three02minutes02later02when02they02went02up02with02
the02porter,02it02turned02out02the02door02was02unfastened."0202
"That's02just02it;02the02murderer02must02have02been02there02and02
bolted02himself02in;02and02they'd02have02caught02him02for02a02
certainty02if02Koch02had02not02been02an02ass02and02gone02to02look02for02

"And02no02one02saw02the02murderer?"0202
"They02might02well02not02see02him;02the02house02is02a02regular02
Noah's02Ark,"02said02the02head02clerk,02who02was02listening.0202
"It's02clear,02quite02clear,"02Nikodim02Fomitch02repeated02
warmly.0202
is02 anything02 but02 clear,"02
"No,02

Ilya02 Petrovitch02
maintained.0202
Raskolnikov02picked02up02his02hat02and02walked02towards02the02
door,02but02he02did02not02reach02it....0202
When02he02recovered02consciousness,02he02found02himself02
sitting02in02a02chair,02supported02by02someone02on02the02right02side,02
while02someone02else02was02standing02on02the02left,02holding02a02
yellowish02glass02filled02with02yellow02water,02and02Nikodim02
Fomitch02standing02before02him,02looking02intently02at02him.02He02
got02up02from02the02chair.0202
"What's02this?02Are02you02ill?"02Nikodim02Fomitch02asked,02
rather02sharply.0202
"He02could02hardly02hold02his02pen02when02he02was02signing,"02
said02the02head02clerk,02settling02back02in02his02place,02and02taking02
up02his02work02again.0202
"Have02you02been02ill02long?"02cried02Ilya02Petrovitch02from02his02
place,02where02he,02too,02was02looking02through02papers.02He02had,02
of02course,02come02to02look02at02the02sick02man02when02he02fainted,02
but02retired02at02once02when02he02recovered.0202
"Since02yesterday,"02muttered02Raskolnikov02in02reply.0202
"Did02you02go02out02yesterday?"0202
"Yes."0202
"Though02you02were02ill?"0202
"Yes."0202
"At02what02time?"0202
"About02seven."0202
"And02where02did02you02go,02my02I02ask?"0202
"Along02the02street."0202
"Short02and02clear."0202
Raskolnikov,02white02as02a02handkerchief,02had02answered02
sharply,02jerkily,02without02dropping02his02black02feverish02eyes02
before02Ilya02Petrovitch's02stare.0202
"He02can02scarcely02stand02upright.02And02you..."02Nikodim02
Fomitch02was02beginning.0202
Ilya02 Petrovitch02 pronounced02 rather02
"No02 matter,"02
peculiarly.0202
Nikodim02Fomitch02would02have02made02some02further02
protest,02but02glancing02at02the02head02clerk02who02was02looking02
very02hard02at02him,02he02did02not02speak.02There02was02a02sudden02
silence.02It02was02strange.0202
"Very02well,02then,"02concluded02Ilya02Petrovitch,02"we02will02
not02detain02you."0202
Raskolnikov02went02out.02He02caught02the02sound02of02eager02
conversation02on02his02departure,02and02above02the02rest02rose02the02
questioning02voice02of02Nikodim02Fomitch.02In02the02street,02his02
faintness02passed02off02completely.0202
"A02search―there02will02be02a02search02at02once,"02he02repeated02
to02himself,02hurrying02home.02"The02brutes!02they02suspect."0202
His02former02terror02mastered02him02completely02again.0202

CHAPTER02II0202
"And02what02if02there02has02been02a02search02already?02What02if02I02
find02them02in02my02room?"0202
But02here02was02his02room.02Nothing02and02no02one02in02it.02No02one02
had02peeped02in.02Even02Nastasya02had02not02touched02it.02But02
heavens!02how02could02he02have02left02all02those02things02in02the02
hole?0202He02rushed02to02the02corner,02slipped02his02hand02under02the02
paper,02pulled02the02things02out02and02lined02his02pockets02with02
them.02There02were02eight02articles02in02all:02two02little02boxes02with02
ear\rings02or02something02of02the02sort,02he02hardly02looked02to02see;02
then02four02small02leather02cases.02There02was02a02chain,02too,02
merely02wrapped02in02newspaper02and02something02else02in02
newspaper,02that02looked02like02a02decoration....02He02put02them02all02
in02the02different02pockets02of02his02overcoat,02and02the02remaining02
pocket02of02his02trousers,02trying02to02conceal02them02as02much02as02
possible.02He02took02the02purse,02too.02Then02he02went02out02of02his02
room,02leaving02the02door02open.02He02walked02quickly02and02
resolutely,02and02though02he02felt02shattered,02he02had02his02senses02
about02him.02He02was02afraid02of02pursuit,02he02was02afraid02that02in02
another02half\hour,02another02quarter02of02an02hour02perhaps,02
instructions02would02be02issued02for02his02pursuit,02and02so02at02all02
costs,02he02must02hide02all02traces02before02then.02He02must02clear02
everything02up02while02he02still02had02some02strength,02some02
reasoning02power02left02him....02Where02was02he02to02go?0202
That02had02long02been02settled:02"Fling02them02into02the02canal,02
and02all02traces02hidden02in02the02water,02the02thing02would02be02at02an02
end."02So02he02had02decided02in02the02night02of02his02delirium02when02
several02times02he02had02had02the02impulse02to02get02up02and02go02
away,02to02make02haste,02and02get02rid02of02it02all.02But02to02get02rid02of02it,02
turned02out02to02be02a02very02difficult02task.02He02wandered02along02
the02bank02of02the02Ekaterininsky02Canal02for02half02an02hour02or02
more02and02looked02several02times02at02the02steps02running02down02
to02the02water,02but02he02could02not02think02of02carrying02out02his02
plan;02either02rafts02stood02at02the02steps'02edge,02and02women02
were02washing02clothes02on02them,02or02boats02were02moored02
there,02and02people02were02swarming02everywhere.02Moreover02
he02could02be02seen02and02noticed02from02the02banks02on02all02sides;02it02
would02look02suspicious02for02a02man02to02go02down02on02purpose,02
stop,02and02throw02something02into02the02water.02And02what02if02the02
boxes02were02to02float02instead02of02sinking?02And02of02course02they02
would.02Even02as02it02was,02everyone02he02met02seemed02to02stare02
and02look02round,02as02if02they02had02nothing02to02do02but02to02watch02
him.02"Why02is02it,02or02can02it02be02my02fancy?"02he02thought.0202
At02last02the02thought02struck02him02that02it02might02be02better02to02
go02to02the02Neva.02There02were02not02so02many02people02there,02he02
would02be02less02observed,02and02it02would02be02more02convenient02
in02every02way,02above02all02it02was02further02off.02He02wondered02
how02he02could02have02been02wandering02for02a02good02half\hour,02
worried02and02anxious02in02this02dangerous02past02without02
thinking02of02it02before.02And02that02half\hour02he02had02lost02over02
an02irrational02plan,02simply02because02he02had02thought02of02it02in02
delirium!02He02had02become02extremely02absent02and02forgetful02
and02he02was02aware02of02it.02He02certainly02must02make02haste.0202
He02walked02towards02the02Neva02along02V――02Prospect,02but02
on02the02way02another02idea02struck02him.02"Why02to02the02Neva?02
Would02it02not02be02better02to02go02somewhere02far02off,02to02the02
Islands02again,02and02there02hide02the02things02in02some02solitary02
place,02in02a02wood02or02under02a02bush,02and02mark02the02spot02
perhaps?"02And02though02he02felt02incapable02of02clear02judgment,02
the02idea02seemed02to02him02a02sound02one.02But02he02was02not02
destined02to02go02there.02For02coming02out02of02V――02Prospect02
towards02the02square,02he02saw02on02the02left02a02passage02leading02
between02two02blank02walls02to02a02courtyard.02On02the02right02hand,02
"Standing02 here02
the02blank02unwhitewashed02wall02of02a02four\storied02house02
stretched02far02into02the02court;02on02the02left,02a02wooden02hoarding02
ran02parallel02with02it02for02twenty02paces02into02the02court,02and02
then02turned02sharply02to02the02left.02Here02was02a02deserted02
fenced\off02place02where02rubbish02of02different02sorts02was02lying.02
At02the02end02of02the02court,02the02corner02of02a02low,02smutty,02stone02
shed,02apparently02part02of02some02workshop,02peeped02from02
behind02the02hoarding.02It02was02probably02a02carriage02builder's02
or02carpenter's02shed;02the02whole02place02from02the02entrance02
was02black02with02coal02dust.02Here02would02be02the02place02to02throw02
it,02he02thought.02Not02seeing02anyone02in02the02yard,02he02slipped02in,02
and02at02once02saw02near02the02gate02a02sink,02such02as02is02often02put02in02
yards02where02there02are02many02workmen02or02cab\drivers;02and02
on02the02hoarding02above02had02been02scribbled02in02chalk02the02
time\honoured02 witticism,02
strictly02
forbidden."02This02was02all02the02better,02for02there02would02be02
nothing02suspicious02about02his02going02in.02"Here02I02could02throw02
it02all02in02a02heap02and02get02away!"0202
Looking02round02once02more,02with02his02hand02already02in02his02
pocket,02he02noticed02against02the02outer02wall,02between02the02
entrance02and02the02sink,02a02big02unhewn02stone,02weighing02
perhaps02sixty02pounds.02The02other02side02of02the02wall02was02a02
street.02He02could02hear02passers\by,02always02numerous02in02that02
part,02but02he02could02not02be02seen02from02the02entrance,02unless02
someone02came02in02from02the02street,02which02might02well02
happen02indeed,02so02there02was02need02of02haste.0202
He02bent02down02over02the02stone,02seized02the02top02of02it02firmly02
in02both02hands,02and02using02all02his02strength02turned02it02over.02
Under02the02stone02was02a02small02hollow02in02the02ground,02and02he02
immediately02emptied02his02pocket02into02it.02The02purse02lay02at02
the02top,02and02yet02the02hollow02was02not02filled02up.02Then02he02
seized02the02stone02again02and02with02one02twist02turned02it02back,02
so02that02it02was02in02the02same02position02again,02though02it02stood02a02
very02little02higher.02But02he02scraped02the02earth02about02it02and02
pressed02it02at02the02edges02with02his02foot.02Nothing02could02be02
noticed.0202
Then02he02went02out,02and02turned02into02the02square.02Again02an02
intense,02almost02unbearable02joy02overwhelmed02him02for02an02
instant,02as02it02had02in02the02police\office.02"I02have02buried02my02
tracks!02And02who,02who02can02think02of02looking02under02that02
stone?02It02has02been02lying02there02most02likely02ever02since02the02
house02was02built,02and02will02lie02as02many02years02more.02And02if02it02
were02found,02who02would02think02of02me?02It02is02all02over!02No02
clue!"02And02he02laughed.02Yes,02he02remembered02that02he02began02
laughing02a02thin,02nervous02noiseless02laugh,02and02went02on02
laughing02all02the02time02he02was02crossing02the02square.02But02when02
he02reached02the02K――02Boulevard02where02two02days02before02he02
had02come02upon02that02girl,02his02laughter02suddenly02ceased.02
Other02ideas02crept02into02his02mind.02He02felt02all02at02once02that02it02
would02be02loathsome02to02pass02that02seat02on02which02after02the02
girl02was02gone,02he02had02sat02and02pondered,02and02that02it02would02
be02hateful,02too,02to02meet02that02whiskered02policeman02to02
whom02he02had02given02the02twenty02copecks:02"Damn02him!"0202
He02walked,02looking02about02him02angrily02and02distractedly.02
All02his02ideas02now02seemed02to02be02circling02round02some02single02
point,02and02he02felt02that02there02really02was02such02a02point,02and02
that02now,02now,02he02was02left02facing02that02point―and02for02the02
first02time,02indeed,02during02the02last02two02months.0202
"Damn02it02all!"02he02thought02suddenly,02in02a02fit02of02
ungovernable02fury.02"If02it02has02begun,02then02it02has02begun.02
Hang02the02new02life!02Good02Lord,02how02stupid02it02is!...02And02what02

care02for02them02all,02and02my02fawning02upon02them!02It02is02not02that02
at02all!02It02is02not02that02at02all!"0202
Suddenly02he02stopped;02a02new02utterly02unexpected02and02
exceedingly02 simple02 question02 perplexed02 and02 bitterly02
confounded02him.0202
"If02it02all02has02really02been02done02deliberately02and02not02
idiotically,02if02I02really02had02a02certain02and02definite02object,02how02
is02it02I02did02not02even02glance02into02the02purse02and02don't02know02
what02I02had02there,02for02which02I02have02undergone02these02
agonies,02and02have02deliberately02undertaken02this02base,02filthy02
degrading02business?02And02here02I02wanted02at02once02to02throw02
into02the02water02the02purse02together02with02all02the02things02which02
I02had02not02seen02either...02how's02that?"0202
Yes,02that02was02so,02that02was02all02so.02Yet02he02had02known02it02all02
before,02and02it02was02not02a02new02question02for02him,02even02when02
it02was02decided02in02the02night02without02hesitation02and02
consideration,02as02though02so02it02must02be,02as02though02it02could02
not02possibly02be02otherwise....02Yes,02he02had02known02it02all,02and02
understood02it02all;02it02surely02had02all02been02settled02even02
yesterday02at02the02moment02when02he02was02bending02over02the02
box02and02pulling02the02jewel\cases02out02of02it....02Yes,02so02it02was.0202
"It02is02because02I02am02very02ill,"02he02decided02grimly02at02last,02"I02
have02been02worrying02and02fretting02myself,02and02I02don't02know02
what02I02am02doing....02Yesterday02and02the02day02before02yesterday02
and02all02this02time02I02have02been02worrying02myself....02I02shall02get02
well02and02I02shall02not02worry....02But02what02if02I02don't02get02well02at02
all?02Good02God,02how02sick02I02am02of02it02all!"0202
He02walked02on02without02resting.02He02had02a02terrible02longing02
for02some02distraction,02but02he02did02not02know02what02to02do,02what02
to02attempt.02A02new02overwhelming02sensation02was02gaining02
more02and02more02mastery02over02him02every02moment;02this02was02
an02
immeasurable,02 almost02 physical,02
repulsion02
for02
everything02surrounding02him,02an02obstinate,02malignant02
feeling02of02hatred.02All02who02met02him02were02loathsome02to02
him―he02loathed02their02faces,02their02movements,02their02
gestures.02If02anyone02had02addressed02him,02he02felt02that02he02
might02have02spat02at02him02or02bitten02him....0202
He02stopped02suddenly,02on02coming02out02on02the02bank02of02the02
Little02Neva,02near02the02bridge02to02Vassilyevsky02Ostrov.02"Why,02
he02lives02here,02in02that02house,"02he02thought,02"why,02I02have02not02
come02to02Razumihin02of02my02own02accord!02Here02it's02the02same02
thing02over02again....02Very02interesting02to02know,02though;02have02I02
come02on02purpose02or02have02I02simply02walked02here02by02chance?02
Never02mind,02I02said02the02day02before02yesterday02that02I02would02
go02and02see02him02the02day02after;02well,02and02so02I02will!02Besides02I02
really02cannot02go02further02now."0202
He02went02up02to02Razumihin's02room02on02the02fifth02floor.0202
The02latter02was02at02home02in02his02garret,02busily02writing02at02
the02moment,02and02he02opened02the02door02himself.02It02was02four02
months02since02they02had02seen02each02other.02Razumihin02was02
sitting02in02a02ragged02dressing\gown,02with02slippers02on02his02
bare02feet,02unkempt,02unshaven02and02unwashed.02His02face02
showed02surprise.0202
"Is02it02you?"02he02cried.02He02looked02his02comrade02up02and02
down;02then02after02a02brief02pause,02he02whistled.02"As02hard02up02as02
all02that!02Why,02brother,02you've02cut02me02out!"02he02added,02
looking02at02Raskolnikov's02rags.02"Come02sit02down,02you02are02
tired,02I'll02be02bound."0202
And02when02he02had02sunk02down02on02the02American02leather02
sofa,02which02was02in02even02worse02condition02than02his02own,02
Razumihin02saw02at02once02that02his02visitor02was02ill.0202
"Why,02you02are02seriously02ill,02do02you02know02that?"02He02
began02feeling02his02pulse.02Raskolnikov02pulled02away02his02hand.0202
"Never02mind,"02he02said,02"I02have02come02for02this:02I02have02no02
lessons....02I02wanted,...02but02I02don't02really02want02lessons...."0202
"But02I02say!02You02are02delirious,02you02know!"02Razumihin02
observed,02watching02him02carefully.0202
"No,02I02am02not."0202
Raskolnikov02got02up02from02the02sofa.02As02he02had02mounted02
the02stairs02to02Razumihin's,02he02had02not02realised02that02he02
would02be02meeting02his02friend02face02to02face.02Now,02in02a02flash,02he02
knew,02that02what02he02was02least02of02all02disposed02for02at02that02
moment02was02to02be02face02to02face02with02anyone02in02the02wide02
world.02His02spleen02rose02within02him.02He02almost02choked02with02
rage02at02himself02as02soon02as02he02crossed02Razumihin's02
threshold.0202
"Good\bye,"02he02said02abruptly,02and02walked02to02the02door.0202
"Stop,02stop!02You02queer02fish."0202
"I02don't02want02to,"02said02the02other,02again02pulling02away02his02
hand.0202
"Then02why02the02devil02have02you02come?02Are02you02mad,02or02
what?02Why,02this02is...02almost02insulting!02I02won't02let02you02go02

"Well,02then,02I02came02to02you02because02I02know02no02one02but02

"Stay02a02minute,02you02sweep!02You02are02a02perfect02madman.02

Raskolnikov02took02the02German02sheets02in02silence,02took02the02
three02roubles02and02without02a02word02went02out.02Razumihin02
gazed02after02him02in02astonishment.02But02when02Raskolnikov02
was02in02the02next02street,02he02turned02back,02mounted02the02stairs02
to02Razumihin's02again02and02laying02on02the02table02the02German02
article02and02the02three02roubles,02went02out02again,02still02without02
uttering02a02word.0202
"Are02you02raving,02or02what?"02Razumihin02shouted,02roused02
to02fury02at02last.02"What02farce02is02this?02You'll02drive02me02crazy02
too...02what02did02you02come02to02see02me02for,02damn02you?"0202
"I02don't02want...02translation,"02muttered02Raskolnikov02from02
the02stairs.0202
"Then02what02the02devil02do02you02want?"02shouted02Razumihin02
from02 above.02 Raskolnikov02 continued02 descending02 the02
staircase02in02silence.0202
"Hey,02there!02Where02are02you02living?"0202
No02answer.0202
"Well,02confound02you02then!"0202
But02Raskolnikov02was02already02stepping02into02the02street.02
On02 the02 Nikolaevsky02 Bridge02 he02 was02 roused02 to02 full02
consciousness02 again02 by02 an02 unpleasant02
incident.02 A02
coachman,02after02shouting02at02him02two02or02three02times,02gave02
him02a02violent02lash02on02the02back02with02his02whip,02for02having02
almost02fallen02under02his02horses'02hoofs.02The02lash02so02
infuriated02him02that02he02dashed02away02to02the02railing02(for02
some02unknown02reason02he02had02been02walking02in02the02very02
middle02of02the02bridge02in02the02traffic).02He02angrily02clenched02
and02ground02his02teeth.02He02heard02laughter,02of02course.0202
"Serves02him02right!"0202
"A02pickpocket02I02dare02say."0202
"Pretending02to02be02drunk,02for02sure,02and02getting02under02the02
wheels02on02purpose;02and02you02have02to02answer02for02him."0202
"It's02a02regular02profession,02that's02what02it02is."0202
But02while02he02stood02at02the02railing,02still02looking02angry02and02
bewildered02after02the02retreating02carriage,02and02rubbing02his02
back,02he02suddenly02felt02someone02thrust02money02into02his02
hand.02He02looked.02It02was02an02elderly02woman02in02a02kerchief02and02
goatskin02shoes,02with02a02girl,02probably02her02daughter02wearing02
a02hat,02and02carrying02a02green02parasol.0202
"Take02it,02my02good02man,02in02Christ's02name."0202
He02took02it02and02they02passed02on.02It02was02a02piece02of02twenty02
copecks.02From02his02dress02and02appearance02they02might02well02
have02taken02him02for02a02beggar02asking02alms02in02the02streets,02and02
the02gift02of02the02twenty02copecks02he02doubtless02owed02to02the02
blow,02which02made02them02feel02sorry02for02him.0202
He02closed02his02hand02on02the02twenty02copecks,02walked02on02
for02ten02paces,02and02turned02facing02the02Neva,02looking02towards02
the02palace.02The02sky02was02without02a02cloud02and02the02water02was02
almost02bright02blue,02which02is02so02rare02in02the02Neva.02The02
cupola02of02the02cathedral,02which02is02seen02at02its02best02from02the02
bridge02about02twenty02paces02from02the02chapel,02glittered02in02the02
sunlight,02and02in02the02pure02air02every02ornament02on02it02could02be02
clearly02distinguished.02The02pain02from02the02lash02went02off,02and02
Raskolnikov02forgot02about02it;02one02uneasy02and02not02quite02
definite02idea02occupied02him02now02completely.02He02stood02still,02
and02gazed02long02and02intently02into02the02distance;02this02spot02
was02especially02familiar02to02him.02When02he02was02attending02the02
university,02he02had02hundreds02of02times―generally02on02his02
way02home―stood02still02on02this02spot,02gazed02at02this02truly02
magnificent02spectacle02and02almost02always02marvelled02at02a02
vague02and02mysterious02emotion02it02roused02in02him.02It02left02him02
strangely02cold;02this02gorgeous02picture02was02for02him02blank02
and02lifeless.02He02wondered02every02time02at02his02sombre02and02
enigmatic02impression02and,02mistrusting02himself,02put02off02
finding02the02explanation02of02it.02He02vividly02recalled02those02old02
doubts02and02perplexities,02and02it02seemed02to02him02that02it02was02
no02mere02chance02that02he02recalled02them02now.02It02struck02him02
as02strange02and02grotesque,02that02he02should02have02stopped02at02
the02same02spot02as02before,02as02though02he02actually02imagined02he02
could02think02the02same02thoughts,02be02interested02in02the02same02
theories02and02pictures02that02had02interested02him...02so02short02a02
time02ago.02He02felt02it02almost02amusing,02and02yet02it02wrung02his02
heart.02Deep02down,02hidden02far02away02out02of02sight02all02that02
seemed02to02him02now―all02his02old02past,02his02old02thoughts,02his02
old02problems02and02theories,02his02old02impressions02and02that02
picture02and02himself02and02all,02all....02He02felt02as02though02he02were02
flying02upwards,02and02everything02were02vanishing02from02his02
sight.02Making02an02unconscious02movement02with02his02hand,02he02
suddenly02became02aware02of02the02piece02of02money02in02his02fist.02
He02opened02his02hand,02stared02at02the02coin,02and02with02a02sweep02
of02his02arm02flung02it02into02the02water;02then02he02turned02and02went02
home.02It02seemed02to02him,02he02had02cut02himself02off02from02
everyone02and02from02everything02at02that02moment.0202
Evening02was02coming02on02when02he02reached02home,02so02that02
he02must02have02been02walking02about02six02hours.02How02and02
where02he02came02back02he02did02not02remember.02Undressing,02
and02quivering02like02an02overdriven02horse,02he02lay02down02on02
the02sofa,02drew02his02greatcoat02over02him,02and02at02once02sank02
into02oblivion....0202
It02was02dusk02when02he02was02waked02up02by02a02fearful02scream.02
Good02God,02what02a02scream!02Such02unnatural02sounds,02such02
howling,02wailing,02grinding,02tears,02blows02and02curses02he02had02
never02heard.0202
He02could02never02have02imagined02such02brutality,02such02
frenzy.02In02terror02he02sat02up02in02bed,02almost02swooning02with02
agony.02But02the02fighting,02wailing02and02cursing02grew02louder02
and02louder.02And02then02to02his02intense02amazement02he02caught02
the02voice02of02his02landlady.02She02was02howling,02shrieking02and02
wailing,02rapidly,02hurriedly,02incoherently,02so02that02he02could02
not02make02out02what02she02was02talking02about;02she02was02
beseeching,02no02doubt,02not02to02be02beaten,02for02she02was02being02
mercilessly02beaten02on02the02stairs.02The02voice02of02her02assailant02
was02so02horrible02from02spite02and02rage02that02it02was02almost02a02
croak;02but02he,02too,02was02saying02something,02and02just02as02
quickly02and02indistinctly,02hurrying02and02spluttering.02All02at02
once02Raskolnikov02trembled;02he02recognised02the02voice―it02
was02the02voice02of02Ilya02Petrovitch.02Ilya02Petrovitch02here02and02
beating02the02landlady!02He02is02kicking02her,02banging02her02head02
against02the02steps―that's02clear,02that02can02be02told02from02the02
sounds,02from02the02cries02and02the02thuds.02How02is02it,02is02the02
world02topsy\turvy?02He02could02hear02people02running02in02
crowds02from02all02the02storeys02and02all02the02staircases;02he02heard02
voices,02exclamations,02knocking,02doors02banging.02"But02why,02
why,02and02how02could02it02be?"02he02repeated,02thinking02seriously02
that02he02had02gone02mad.02But02no,02he02heard02too02distinctly!02And02
they02would02come02to02him02then02next,02"for02no02doubt...02it's02all02
about02that...02about02yesterday....02Good02God!"02He02would02have02
fastened02his02door02with02the02latch,02but02he02could02not02lift02his02
hand...02besides,02it02would02be02useless.02Terror02gripped02his02
heart02like02ice,02tortured02him02and02numbed02him....02But02at02last02
all02this02uproar,02after02continuing02about02ten02minutes,02began02
gradually02to02subside.02The02landlady02was02moaning02and02
groaning;02Ilya02Petrovitch02was02still02uttering02threats02and02
curses....02But02at02last02he,02too,02seemed02to02be02silent,02and02now02
he02could02not02be02heard.02"Can02he02have02gone02away?02Good02
Lord!"02Yes,02and02now02the02landlady02is02going02too,02still02weeping02
and02moaning...02and02then02her02door02slammed....02Now02the02
crowd02 was02 going02 from02 the02 stairs02 to02 their02 rooms,02
exclaiming,02disputing,02calling02to02one02another,02raising02their02
voices02to02a02shout,02dropping02them02to02a02whisper.02There02must02
have02been02numbers02of02them―almost02all02the02inmates02of02the02
block.02"But,02good02God,02how02could02it02be!02And02why,02why02had02
he02come02here!"0202
Raskolnikov02sank02worn02out02on02the02sofa,02but02could02not02
close02his02eyes.02He02lay02for02half02an02hour02in02such02anguish,02such02
an02intolerable02sensation02of02infinite02terror02as02he02had02never02
experienced02before.02Suddenly02a02bright02light02flashed02into02his02
room.02Nastasya02came02in02with02a02candle02and02a02plate02of02soup.02
Looking02at02him02carefully02and02ascertaining02that02he02was02not02
asleep,02she02set02the02candle02on02the02table02and02began02to02lay02out02
what02she02had02brought―bread,02salt,02a02plate,02a02spoon.0202
"You've02eaten02nothing02since02yesterday,02I02warrant.02
You've02been02trudging02about02all02day,02and02you're02shaking02
with02fever."0202
"Nastasya...02what02were02they02beating02the02landlady02for?"0202
She02looked02intently02at02him.0202
"Who02beat02the02landlady?"0202
"Just02now...02half02an02hour02ago,02Ilya02Petrovitch,02the02
assistant02superintendent,02on02the02stairs....02Why02was02he02ill\
treating02her02like02that,02and...02why02was02he02here?"0202
Nastasya02scrutinised02him,02silent02and02frowning,02and02her02
scrutiny02lasted02a02long02time.02He02felt02uneasy,02even02frightened02
at02her02searching02eyes.0202
"Nastasya,02why02don't02you02speak?"02he02said02timidly02at02last02
in02a02weak02voice.0202
"It's02the02blood,"02she02answered02at02last02softly,02as02though02
speaking02to02herself.0202
"Blood?02What02blood?"02he02muttered,02growing02white02and02
turning02towards02the02wall.0202
Nastasya02still02looked02at02him02without02speaking.0202
"Nobody02has02been02beating02the02landlady,"02she02declared02
at02last02in02a02firm,02resolute02voice.0202
He02gazed02at02her,02hardly02able02to02breathe.0202
"I02heard02it02myself....02I02was02not02asleep...02I02was02sitting02up,"02
he02said02still02more02timidly.02"I02listened02a02long02while.02The02
assistant02superintendent02came....02Everyone02ran02out02on02to02
the02stairs02from02all02the02flats."0202
"No02one02has02been02here.02That's02the02blood02crying02in02your02
ears.02When02there's02no02outlet02for02it02and02it02gets02clotted,02you02
begin02fancying02things....02Will02you02eat02something?"0202
He02made02no02answer.02Nastasya02still02stood02over02him,02
watching02him.0202
"Give02me02something02to02drink...02Nastasya."0202
She02went02downstairs02and02returned02with02a02white02
earthenware02
jug02 of02 water.02 He02 remembered02 only02
swallowing02one02sip02of02the02cold02water02and02spilling02some02on02
his02neck.02Then02followed02forgetfulness.0202
02
0202
CHAPTER02III0202
He02was02not02completely02unconscious,02however,02all02the02
time02he02was02ill;02he02was02in02a02feverish02state,02sometimes02
delirious,02sometimes02half02conscious.02He02remembered02a02
great02deal02afterwards.02Sometimes02it02seemed02as02though02
there02were02a02number02of02people02round02him;02they02wanted02to02
take02him02away02somewhere,02there02was02a02great02deal02of02
squabbling02and02discussing02about02him.02Then02he02would02be02
alone02in02the02room;02they02had02all02gone02away02afraid02of02him,02
and02only02now02and02then02opened02the02door02a02crack02to02look02at02
him;02they02threatened02him,02plotted02something02together,02
laughed,02and02mocked02at02him.02He02remembered02Nastasya02
often02at02his02bedside;02he02distinguished02another02person,02too,02
whom02he02seemed02to02know02very02well,02though02he02could02not02
remember02who02he02was,02and02this02fretted02him,02even02made02
him02cry.02Sometimes02he02fancied02he02had02been02lying02there02a02
month;02at02other02times02it02all02seemed02part02of02the02same02day.02
But02of02that―of02that02he02had02no02recollection,02and02yet02every02
minute02he02felt02that02he02had02forgotten02something02he02ought02to02
remember.02He02worried02and02tormented02himself02trying02to02
remember,02moaned,02flew02into02a02rage,02or02sank02into02awful,02
intolerable02terror.02Then02he02struggled02to02get02up,02would02have02
run02away,02but02someone02always02prevented02him02by02force,02
and02he02sank02back02into02impotence02and02forgetfulness.02At02last02
he02returned02to02complete02consciousness.0202
It02happened02at02ten02o'clock02in02the02morning.02On02fine02days02
the02sun02shone02into02the02room02at02that02hour,02throwing02a02
streak02of02light02on02the02right02wall02and02the02corner02near02the02
door.02Nastasya02was02standing02beside02him02with02another02
person,02a02complete02stranger,02who02was02looking02at02him02very02
inquisitively.02He02was02a02young02man02with02a02beard,02wearing02a02
full,02short\waisted02coat,02and02looked02like02a02messenger.02The02
in02 at02 the02 half\opened02 door.02
landlady02 was02 peeping02
Raskolnikov02sat02up.0202
"Who02is02this,02Nastasya?"02he02asked,02pointing02to02the02
young02man.0202
"I02say,02he's02himself02again!"02she02said.0202
"He02is02himself,"02echoed02the02man.0202
Concluding02that02he02had02returned02to02his02senses,02the02
landlady02closed02the02door02and02disappeared.02She02was02always02
shy02and02dreaded02conversations02or02discussions.02She02was02a02
woman02of02forty,02not02at02all02bad\looking,02fat02and02buxom,02with02
black02eyes02and02eyebrows,02good\natured02from02fatness02and02
laziness,02and02absurdly02bashful.0202
"Who...02are02you?"02he02went02on,02addressing02the02man.02But02
at02that02moment02the02door02was02flung02open,02and,02stooping02a02
little,02as02he02was02so02tall,02Razumihin02came02in.0202
"What02a02cabin02it02is!"02he02cried.02"I02am02always02knocking02my02
head.02You02call02this02a02lodging!02So02you02are02conscious,02
brother?02I've02just02heard02the02news02from02Pashenka."0202
"He02has02just02come02to,"02said02Nastasya.0202
"Just02come02to,"02echoed02the02man02again,02with02a02smile.0202
"And02 who02 are02 you?"02 Razumihin02 asked,02 suddenly02
addressing02him.02"My02name02is02Vrazumihin,02at02your02service;02
not02Razumihin,02as02I02am02always02called,02but02Vrazumihin,02a02
student02and02gentleman;02and02he02is02my02friend.02And02who02are02
you?"0202
"I02am02the02messenger02from02our02office,02from02the02merchant02
Shelopaev,02and02I've02come02on02business."0202
"Please02sit02down."02Razumihin02seated02himself02on02the02
other02side02of02the02table.02"It's02a02good02thing02you've02come02to,02
brother,"02he02went02on02to02Raskolnikov.02"For02the02last02four02
days02you02have02scarcely02eaten02or02drunk02anything.02We02had02to02
give02you02tea02in02spoonfuls.02I02brought02Zossimov02to02see02you02
twice.02 You02 remember02 Zossimov?02 He02 examined02 you02
carefully02and02said02at02once02it02was02nothing02serious―
something02seemed02to02have02gone02to02your02head.02Some02
nervous02nonsense,02the02result02of02bad02feeding,02he02says02you02
have02not02had02enough02beer02and02radish,02but02it's02nothing02
much,02it02will02pass02and02you02will02be02all02right.02Zossimov02is02a02
first\rate02fellow!02He02is02making02quite02a02name.02Come,02I02won't02
keep02you,"02he02said,02addressing02the02man02again.02"Will02you02
explain02what02you02want?02You02must02know,02Rodya,02this02is02the02
second02time02they02have02sent02from02the02office;02but02it02was02
another02man02last02time,02and02I02talked02to02him.02Who02was02it02
came02before?"0202
"That02was02the02day02before02yesterday,02I02venture02to02say,02if02
you02please,02sir.02That02was02Alexey02Semyonovitch;02he02is02in02our02
office,02too."0202
"He02was02more02intelligent02than02you,02don't02you02think02so?"0202
"Yes,02indeed,02sir,02he02is02of02more02weight02than02I02am."0202
"Quite02so;02go02on."0202
"At02your02mamma's02request,02through02Afanasy02Ivanovitch02
Vahrushin,02of02whom02I02presume02you02have02heard02more02than02
once,02a02remittance02is02sent02to02you02from02our02office,"02the02man02
in02 an02
began,02 addressing02 Raskolnikov.02 "If02 you02 are02
intelligible02condition,02I've02thirty\five02roubles02to02remit02to02
you,02as02Semyon02Semyonovitch02has02received02from02Afanasy02
Ivanovitch02at02your02mamma's02request02instructions02to02that02
effect,02as02on02previous02occasions.02Do02you02know02him,02sir?"0202
"Yes,02 I02 remember...02 Vahrushin,"02 Raskolnikov02 said02
dreamily.0202
"You02hear,02he02knows02Vahrushin,"02cried02Razumihin.02"He02
is02in02'an02intelligible02condition'!02And02I02see02you02are02an02
intelligent02man02too.02Well,02it's02always02pleasant02to02hear02
words02of02wisdom."0202
"That's02the02gentleman,02Vahrushin,02Afanasy02Ivanovitch.02
And02at02the02request02of02your02mamma,02who02has02sent02you02a02
remittance02once02before02in02the02same02manner02through02him,02
he02did02not02refuse02this02time02also,02and02sent02instructions02to02
Semyon02Semyonovitch02some02days02since02to02hand02you02thirty\
five02roubles02in02the02hope02of02better02to02come."0202
"That02'hoping02for02better02to02come'02is02the02best02thing02
you've02said,02though02'your02mamma'02is02not02bad02either.02Come02
then,02what02do02you02say?02Is02he02fully02conscious,02eh?"0202
"That's02all02right.02If02only02he02can02sign02this02little02paper."0202
"He02can02scrawl02his02name.02Have02you02got02the02book?"0202
"Yes,02here's02the02book."0202
"Give02it02to02me.02Here,02Rodya,02sit02up.02I'll02hold02you.02Take02
the02pen02and02scribble02'Raskolnikov'02for02him.02For02just02now,02
brother,02money02is02sweeter02to02us02than02treacle."0202
"I02don't02want02it,"02said02Raskolnikov,02pushing02away02the02
pen.0202
"Not02want02it?"0202
"I02won't02sign02it."0202
"How02the02devil02can02you02do02without02signing02it?"0202
"I02don't02want...02the02money."0202
"Don't02want02the02money!02Come,02brother,02that's02nonsense,02
I02bear02witness.02Don't02trouble,02please,02it's02only02that02he02is02on02
his02travels02again.02But02that's02pretty02common02with02him02at02all02
times02though....02You02are02a02man02of02judgment02and02we02will02
take02him02in02hand,02that02is,02more02simply,02take02his02hand02and02
he02will02sign02it.02Here."0202
"But02I02can02come02another02time."0202
"No,02no.02Why02should02we02trouble02you?02You02are02a02man02of02
judgment....02Now,02Rodya,02don't02keep02your02visitor,02you02see02
he02is02waiting,"02and02he02made02ready02to02hold02Raskolnikov's02
hand02in02earnest.0202
"Stop,02I'll02do02it02alone,"02said02the02latter,02taking02the02pen02and02
signing02his02name.0202
The02messenger02took02out02the02money02and02went02away.0202
"Bravo!02And02now,02brother,02are02you02hungry?"0202
"Yes,"02answered02Raskolnikov.0202
"Is02there02any02soup?"0202
"Some02of02yesterday's,"02answered02Nastasya,02who02was02
still02standing02there.0202
"With02potatoes02and02rice02in02it?"0202
"Yes."0202
"I02know02it02by02heart.02Bring02soup02and02give02us02some02tea."0202
"Very02well."0202
Raskolnikov02
this02 with02 profound02
looked02 at02 all02
astonishment02and02a02dull,02unreasoning02terror.02He02made02up02
his02mind02to02keep02quiet02and02see02what02would02happen.02"I02
believe02I02am02not02wandering.02I02believe02it's02reality,"02he02
thought.0202
In02a02couple02of02minutes02Nastasya02returned02with02the02
soup,02and02announced02that02the02tea02would02be02ready02directly.02
With02the02soup02she02brought02two02spoons,02two02plates,02salt,02
pepper,02mustard02for02the02beef,02and02so02on.02The02table02was02set02
as02it02had02not02been02for02a02long02time.02The02cloth02was02clean.0202
"It02would02not02be02amiss,02Nastasya,02if02Praskovya02Pavlovna02
were02to02send02us02up02a02couple02of02bottles02of02beer.02We02could02
empty02them."0202
"Well,02you02are02a02cool02hand,"02muttered02Nastasya,02and02she02
departed02to02carry02out02his02orders.0202
Raskolnikov02still02gazed02wildly02with02strained02attention.02
Meanwhile02Razumihin02sat02down02on02the02sofa02beside02him,02as02
clumsily02as02a02bear02put02his02left02arm02round02Raskolnikov's02
head,02although02he02was02able02to02sit02up,02and02with02his02right02
hand02gave02him02a02spoonful02of02soup,02blowing02on02it02that02it02
might02not02burn02him.02But02the02soup02was02only02just02warm.02
Raskolnikov02swallowed02one02spoonful02greedily,02then02a02
second,02then02a02third.02But02after02giving02him02a02few02more02
spoonfuls02of02soup,02Razumihin02suddenly02stopped,02and02said02
that02he02must02ask02Zossimov02whether02he02ought02to02have02
more.0202Nastasya02came02in02with02two02bottles02of02beer.0202
"And02will02you02have02tea?"0202
"Yes."0202
"Cut02along,02Nastasya,02and02bring02some02tea,02for02tea02we02
may02venture02on02without02the02faculty.02But02here02is02the02beer!"02
He02moved02back02to02his02chair,02pulled02the02soup02and02meat02in02
front02of02him,02and02began02eating02as02though02he02had02not02
touched02food02for02three02days.0202
"I02must02tell02you,02Rodya,02I02dine02like02this02here02every02day02
now,"02he02mumbled02with02his02mouth02full02of02beef,02"and02it's02all02
Pashenka,02your02dear02little02landlady,02who02sees02to02that;02she02
loves02to02do02anything02for02me.02I02don't02ask02for02it,02but,02of02
course,02I02don't02object.02And02here's02Nastasya02with02the02tea.02
She02is02a02quick02girl.02Nastasya,02my02dear,02won't02you02have02some02
beer?"0202
"Get02along02with02your02nonsense!"0202
"A02cup02of02tea,02then?"0202
"A02cup02of02tea,02maybe."0202
"Pour02it02out.02Stay,02I'll02pour02it02out02myself.02Sit02down."0202
He02poured02out02two02cups,02left02his02dinner,02and02sat02on02the02
sofa02again.02As02before,02he02put02his02left02arm02round02the02sick02
man's02head,02raised02him02up02and02gave02him02tea02in02spoonfuls,02
again02blowing02each02spoonful02steadily02and02earnestly,02as02
though02this02process02was02the02principal02and02most02effective02
means02towards02his02friend's02recovery.02Raskolnikov02said02
nothing02and02made02no02resistance,02though02he02felt02quite02
strong02enough02to02sit02up02on02the02sofa02without02support02and02
could02not02merely02have02held02a02cup02or02a02spoon,02but02even02
perhaps02could02have02walked02about.02But02from02some02queer,02
almost02animal,02cunning02he02conceived02the02idea02of02hiding02his02
strength02and02lying02low02for02a02time,02pretending02if02necessary02
not02to02be02yet02in02full02possession02of02his02faculties,02and02
meanwhile02listening02to02find02out02what02was02going02on.02Yet02he02
could02not02overcome02his02sense02of02repugnance.02After02sipping02
a02dozen02spoonfuls02of02tea,02he02suddenly02released02his02head,02
pushed02the02spoon02away02capriciously,02and02sank02back02on02the02
pillow.02There02were02actually02real02pillows02under02his02head02
now,02down02pillows02in02clean02cases,02he02observed02that,02too,02
and02took02note02of02it.0202
"Pashenka02must02give02us02some02raspberry02jam02to\day02to02
make02him02some02raspberry02tea,"02said02Razumihin,02going02
back02to02his02chair02and02attacking02his02soup02and02beer02again.0202
"And02where02is02she02to02get02raspberries02for02you?"02asked02
Nastasya,02balancing02a02saucer02on02her02five02outspread02fingers02
and02sipping02tea02through02a02lump02of02sugar.0202
"She'll02get02it02at02the02shop,02my02dear.02You02see,02Rodya,02all02

"My02name!"0202
"I02should02think02so;02and02yet02a02General02Kobelev02they02could02

"He's02got02round02her,"02Nastasya02murmured,02smiling02
slyly.0202"Why02don't02you02put02the02sugar02in02your02tea,02Nastasya02
Nikiforovna?"0202
"You02are02a02one!"02Nastasya02cried02suddenly,02going02off02into02
a02giggle.02"I02am02not02Nikiforovna,02but02Petrovna,"02she02added02
suddenly,02recovering02from02her02mirth.0202
"I'll02make02a02note02of02it.02Well,02brother,02to02make02a02long02

Raskolnikov02did02not02speak,02but02he02still02kept02his02eyes02
fixed02upon02him,02full02of02alarm.0202
"And02all02that02could02be02wished,02indeed,02in02every02respect,"02
Razumihin02went02on,02not02at02all02embarrassed02by02his02silence.0202
"Ah,02the02sly02dog!"02Nastasya02shrieked02again.02This02
conversation02afforded02her02unspeakable02delight.0202
"It's02a02pity,02brother,02that02you02did02not02set02to02work02in02the02

would02think02at02first02sight?"0202
"No,"02mumbled02Raskolnikov,02looking02away,02but02feeling02
that02it02was02better02to02keep02up02the02conversation.0202
"She02isn't,02is02she?"02cried02Razumihin,02delighted02to02get02an02
answer02out02of02him.02"But02she02is02not02very02clever02either,02eh?02

Razumihin02put02the02note02on02the02table.02Raskolnikov02
looked02at02him02and02turned02to02the02wall02without02uttering02a02
word.02Even02Razumihin02felt02a02twinge.0202
"I02see,02brother,"02he02said02a02moment02later,02"that02I02have02
been02playing02the02fool02again.02I02thought02I02should02amuse02you02

"Was02it02you02I02did02not02recognise02when02I02was02delirious?"02
Raskolnikov02asked,02after02a02moment's02pause02without02
turning02his02head.0202
"Yes,02and02you02flew02into02a02rage02about02it,02especially02when02
I02brought02Zametov02one02day."0202
"Zametov?02The02head02clerk?02What02for?"02Raskolnikov02
turned02round02quickly02and02fixed02his02eyes02on02Razumihin.0202
"What's02the02matter02with02you?...02What02are02you02upset02
about?02He02wanted02to02make02your02acquaintance02because02I02

"What02did02I02rave02about?"0202
"What02next?02What02did02you02rave02about?02What02people02do02

"What02did02I02rave02about?"0202
"How02he02keeps02on!02Are02you02afraid02of02having02let02out02
some02secret?02Don't02worry02yourself;02you02said02nothing02about02
a02countess.02But02you02said02a02lot02about02a02bulldog,02and02about02

'Give02me02my02sock.'02Zametov02hunted02all02about02your02room02
for02your02socks,02and02with02his02own02scented,02ring\bedecked02

comforted,02and02for02the02next02twenty\four02hours02you02held02
the02wretched02thing02in02your02hand;02we02could02not02get02it02from02
you.02It02is02most02likely02somewhere02under02your02quilt02at02this02
moment.02And02then02you02asked02so02piteously02for02fringe02for02
your02trousers.02We02tried02to02find02out02what02sort02of02fringe,02but02
we02could02not02make02it02out.02Now02to02business!02Here02are02
thirty\five02roubles;02I02take02ten02of02them,02and02shall02give02you02

long02ago,02for02it02is02nearly02twelve.02And02you,02Nastasya,02look02in02
pretty02often02while02I02am02away,02to02see02whether02he02wants02a02
drink02or02anything02else.02And02I02will02tell02Pashenka02what02is02
wanted02myself.02Good\bye!"0202
"He02calls02her02Pashenka!02Ah,02he's02a02deep02one!"02said02
Nastasya02as02he02went02out;02then02she02opened02the02door02and02
stood02listening,02but02could02not02resist02running02downstairs02
after02him.02She02was02very02eager02to02hear02what02he02would02say02to02
the02landlady.02She02was02evidently02quite02fascinated02by02
Razumihin.0202
No02sooner02had02she02left02the02room02than02the02sick02man02
flung02off02the02bedclothes02and02leapt02out02of02bed02like02a02
madman.02With02burning,02twitching02impatience02he02had02
waited02for02them02to02be02gone02so02that02he02might02set02to02work.02
But02to02what02work?02Now,02as02though02to02spite02him,02it02eluded02
him.0202"Good02God,02only02tell02me02one02thing:02do02they02know02of02it02
yet02or02not?02What02if02they02know02it02and02are02only02pretending,02

forgotten,02as02though02on02purpose;02forgotten02it02all02at02once,02I02

He02stood02in02the02middle02of02the02room02and02gazed02in02
miserable02bewilderment02about02him;02he02walked02to02the02door,02
opened02it,02listened;02but02that02was02not02what02he02wanted.02
Suddenly,02as02though02recalling02something,02he02rushed02to02the02
corner02where02there02was02a02hole02under02the02paper,02began02
examining02it,02put02his02hand02into02the02hole,02fumbled―but02that02
was02not02it.02He02went02to02the02stove,02opened02it02and02began02
rummaging02in02the02ashes;02the02frayed02edges02of02his02trousers02
and02the02rags02cut02off02his02pocket02were02lying02there02just02as02he02
had02thrown02them.02No02one02had02looked,02then!02Then02he02
remembered02the02sock02about02which02Razumihin02had02just02
been02telling02him.02Yes,02there02it02lay02on02the02sofa02under02the02
quilt,02but02it02was02so02covered02with02dust02and02grime02that02
Zametov02could02not02have02seen02anything02on02it.0202
"Bah,02Zametov!02The02police02office!02And02why02am02I02sent02for02
to02the02police02office?02Where's02the02notice?02Bah!02I02am02mixing02
it02up;02that02was02then.02I02looked02at02my02sock02then,02too,02but02
now...02now02I02have02been02ill.02But02what02did02Zametov02come02for?02
Why02did02Razumihin02bring02him?"02he02muttered,02helplessly02
sitting02on02the02sofa02again.02"What02does02it02mean?02Am02I02still02in02
delirium,02or02is02it02real?02I02believe02it02is02real....02Ah,02I02remember;02
I02must02escape!02Make02haste02to02escape.02Yes,02I02must,02I02must02
escape!02Yes...02but02where?02And02where02are02my02clothes?02I've02
no02boots.02They've02taken02them02away!02They've02hidden02them!02
I02understand!02Ah,02here02is02my02coat―they02passed02that02over!02
And02here02is02money02on02the02table,02thank02God!02And02here's02the02
I02O02U...02I'll02take02the02money02and02go02and02take02another02lodging.02
They02won't02find02me!...02Yes,02but02the02address02bureau?02They'll02
find02me,02Razumihin02will02find02me.02Better02escape02altogether...02
far02away...02to02America,02and02let02them02do02their02worst!02And02
take02the02I02O02U...02it02would02be02of02use02there....02What02else02shall02I02
take?02They02think02I02am02ill!02They02don't02know02that02I02can02walk,02
ha\ha\ha!02I02could02see02by02their02eyes02that02they02know02all02
about02it!02If02only02I02could02get02downstairs!02And02what02if02they02
have02set02a02watch02there―policemen!02What's02this02tea?02Ah,02
and02here02is02beer02left,02half02a02bottle,02cold!"0202
He02snatched02up02the02bottle,02which02still02contained02a02
glassful02of02beer,02and02gulped02it02down02with02relish,02as02though02
quenching02a02flame02in02his02breast.02But02in02another02minute02the02
beer02had02gone02to02his02head,02and02a02faint02and02even02pleasant02
shiver02ran02down02his02spine.02He02lay02down02and02pulled02the02
quilt02over02him.02His02sick02and02incoherent02thoughts02grew02
more02and02more02disconnected,02and02soon02a02light,02pleasant02
drowsiness02came02upon02him.02With02a02sense02of02comfort02he02
nestled02his02head02into02the02pillow,02wrapped02more02closely02
about02him02the02soft,02wadded02quilt02which02had02replaced02the02
old,02ragged02greatcoat,02sighed02softly02and02sank02into02a02deep,02
sound,02refreshing02sleep.0202
He02woke02up,02hearing02someone02come02in.02He02opened02his02
eyes02and02saw02Razumihin02standing02in02the02doorway,02
uncertain02whether02to02come02in02or02not.02Raskolnikov02sat02up02
quickly02on02the02sofa02and02gazed02at02him,02as02though02trying02to02
recall02something.0202
"Ah,02you02are02not02asleep!02Here02I02am!02Nastasya,02bring02in02
the02parcel!"02Razumihin02shouted02down02the02stairs.02"You02shall02
have02the02account02directly."0202
"What02time02is02it?"02asked02Raskolnikov,02looking02round02
uneasily.0202
"Yes,02you02had02a02fine02sleep,02brother,02it's02almost02evening,02
it02will02be02six02o'clock02directly.02You02have02slept02more02than02six02
hours."0202
"Good02heavens!02Have02I?"0202
"And02why02not?02It02will02do02you02good.02What's02the02hurry?02A02
tryst,02is02it?02We've02all02time02before02us.02I've02been02waiting02for02
the02last02three02hours02for02you;02I've02been02up02twice02and02found02
you02asleep.02I've02called02on02Zossimov02twice;02not02at02home,02
only02fancy!02But02no02matter,02he02will02turn02up.02And02I've02been02
out02on02my02own02business,02too.02You02know02I've02been02moving02
to\day,02moving02with02my02uncle.02I02have02an02uncle02living02with02
me02now.02But02that's02no02matter,02to02business.02Give02me02the02
parcel,02Nastasya.02We02will02open02it02directly.02And02how02do02you02
feel02now,02brother?"0202
"I02am02quite02well,02I02am02not02ill.02Razumihin,02have02you02been02
here02long?"0202
"I02tell02you02I've02been02waiting02for02the02last02three02hours."0202
"No,02before."0202
"How02do02you02mean?"0202
"How02long02have02you02been02coming02here?"0202
"Why02I02told02you02all02about02it02this02morning.02Don't02you02
remember?"0202
Raskolnikov02pondered.02The02morning02seemed02like02a02
dream02to02him.02He02could02not02remember02alone,02and02looked02
inquiringly02at02Razumihin.0202
"Hm!"02said02the02latter,02"he02has02forgotten.02I02fancied02then02
that02you02were02not02quite02yourself.02Now02you02are02better02for02
your02sleep....02You02really02look02much02better.02First\rate!02Well,02
to02business.02Look02here,02my02dear02boy."0202
the02 bundle,02 which02 evidently02
He02 began02 untying02
interested02him.0202
"Believe02me,02brother,02this02is02something02specially02near02
my02heart.02For02we02must02make02a02man02of02you.02Let's02begin02
from02the02top.02Do02you02see02this02cap?"02he02said,02taking02out02of02
the02bundle02a02fairly02good02though02cheap02and02ordinary02cap.02
"Let02me02try02it02on."0202
"Presently,02afterwards,"02said02Raskolnikov,02waving02it02off02
pettishly.0202
"Come,02Rodya,02my02boy,02don't02oppose02it,02afterwards02will02
be02too02late;02and02I02shan't02sleep02all02night,02for02I02bought02it02by02

fitting02it02on,02"just02your02size!02A02proper02head\covering02is02the02

he02said,02turning02to02her,02seeing02that02Raskolnikov02did02not02
speak.0202
"Twenty02copecks,02no02more,02I02dare02say,"02answered02
Nastasya.0202
"Twenty02copecks,02silly!"02he02cried,02offended.02"Why,02
nowadays02 you02 would02 cost02 more02 than02 that―eighty02

"Come,02brother,02don't02tell02me02I've02been02trudging02around02

"Money?02Why,02your02own,02what02the02messenger02brought02

"I02remember02now,"02said02Raskolnikov02after02a02long,02sullen02
silence.02Razumihin02looked02at02him,02frowning02and02uneasy.0202
The02 door02 opened02 and02 a02 tall,02 stout02 man02 whose02
appearance02seemed02familiar02to02Raskolnikov02came02in.0202
02
0202
Zossimov02was02a02tall,02fat02man02with02a02puffy,02colourless,02
clean\shaven02face02and02straight02flaxen02hair.02He02wore02
spectacles,02and02a02big02gold02ring02on02his02fat02finger.02He02was02
twenty\seven.02He02had02on02a02light02grey02fashionable02loose02
coat,02light02summer02trousers,02and02everything02about02him02
loose,02fashionable02and02spick02and02span;02his02linen02was02
irreproachable,02his02watch\chain02was02massive.02In02manner02
he02was02slow02and,02as02it02were,02nonchalant,02and02at02the02same02
time02studiously02free02and02easy;02he02made02efforts02to02conceal02
his02self\importance,02but02it02was02apparent02at02every02instant.02
All02his02acquaintances02found02him02tedious,02but02said02he02was02
clever02at02his02work.0202
"I've02been02to02you02twice02to\day,02brother.02You02see,02he's02
come02to02himself,"02cried02Razumihin.0202
"I02see,02I02see;02and02how02do02we02feel02now,02eh?"02said02
Zossimov02to02Raskolnikov,02watching02him02carefully02and,02
sitting02down02at02the02foot02of02the02sofa,02he02settled02himself02as02
comfortably02as02he02could.0202
"He02is02still02depressed,"02Razumihin02went02on.02"We've02just02
changed02his02linen02and02he02almost02cried."0202
"That's02very02natural;02you02might02have02put02it02off02if02he02did02

aching,02eh?"0202
"I02am02well,02I02am02perfectly02well!"02Raskolnikov02declared02
positively02and02irritably.02He02raised02himself02on02the02sofa02and02
looked02at02them02with02glittering02eyes,02but02sank02back02on02to02
the02pillow02at02once02and02turned02to02the02wall.02Zossimov02
watched02him02intently.0202
"Very02good....02Going02on02all02right,"02he02said02lazily.02"Has02he02
eaten02anything?"0202
They02told02him,02and02asked02what02he02might02have.0202
"He02may02have02anything...02soup,02tea...02mushrooms02and02
cucumbers,02of02course,02you02must02not02give02him;02he'd02better02
not02have02meat02either,02and...02but02no02need02to02tell02you02that!"02

"To\morrow02evening02I02shall02take02him02for02a02walk,"02said02
Razumihin.02"We02are02going02to02the02Yusupov02garden02and02then02
to02the02Palais02de02Crystal."0202
"I02would02not02disturb02him02to\morrow02at02all,02but02I02don't02

"Ach,02what02a02nuisance!02I've02got02a02house\warming02party02
to\night;02it's02only02a02step02from02here.02Couldn't02he02come?02He02

Razumihin,02too,02got02up02from02his02seat.0202
"Nothing,"02Raskolnikov02answered02faintly,02turning02to02the02

"He02must02have02waked02from02a02dream,"02Razumihin02said02at02

"Why,02there's02no02supposing.02There's02a02clue,02such02as02it02is,02

"That's02been02proved,"02said02Razumihin02with02apparent02
reluctance,02frowning.02"Koch02recognised02the02jewel\case02and02
gave02the02name02of02the02owner,02who02proved02conclusively02that02
it02was02his."0202
"That's02bad.02Now02another02point.02Did02anyone02see02Nikolay02
at02the02time02that02Koch02and02Pestryakov02were02going02upstairs02
at02first,02and02is02there02no02evidence02about02that?"0202
"Nobody02did02see02him,"02Razumihin02answered02with02
vexation.02 "That's02 the02 worst02 of02
it.02 Even02 Koch02 and02
Pestryakov02did02not02notice02them02on02their02way02upstairs,02
though,02indeed,02their02evidence02could02not02have02been02worth02
much.02They02said02they02saw02the02flat02was02open,02and02that02there02
must02be02work02going02on02in02it,02but02they02took02no02special02
notice02and02could02not02remember02whether02there02actually02
were02men02at02work02in02it."0202
"Hm!...02So02the02only02evidence02for02the02defence02is02that02they02
were02beating02one02another02and02laughing.02That02constitutes02a02
strong02presumption,02but...02How02do02you02explain02the02facts02
yourself?"0202
"How02do02I02explain02them?02What02is02there02to02explain?02It's02
clear.02At02any02rate,02the02direction02in02which02explanation02is02to02
be02sought02is02clear,02and02the02jewel\case02points02to02it.02The02real02

upstairs,02locked02in,02when02Koch02and02Pestryakov02knocked02at02
the02door.02Koch,02like02an02ass,02did02not02stay02at02the02door;02so02the02
murderer02popped02out02and02ran02down,02too;02for02he02had02no02

porter02in02the02flat02when02Nikolay02and02Dmitri02had02just02run02out02
of02it.02He02stopped02there02while02the02porter02and02others02were02
going02upstairs,02waited02till02they02were02out02of02hearing,02and02

There02are02lots02of02people02going02in02and02out.02He02must02have02
dropped02the02ear\rings02out02of02his02pocket02when02he02stood02
behind02the02door,02and02did02not02notice02he02dropped02them,02
because02he02had02other02things02to02think02of.02The02jewel\case02is02a02
conclusive02proof02that02he02did02stand02there....02That's02how02I02
explain02it."0202
"Too02clever!02No,02my02boy,02you're02too02clever.02That02beats02
everything."0202
"But,02why,02why?"0202
"Why,02because02everything02fits02too02well...02it's02too02
melodramatic."0202
"A\ach!"02Razumihin02was02exclaiming,02but02at02that02moment02
the02door02opened02and02a02personage02came02in02who02was02a02
stranger02to02all02present.0202
02
0202
This02was02a02gentleman02no02longer02young,02of02a02stiff02and02
portly02appearance,02and02a02cautious02and02sour02countenance.02
He02began02by02stopping02short02in02the02doorway,02staring02about02
him02with02offensive02and02undisguised02astonishment,02as02
though02asking02himself02what02sort02of02place02he02had02come02to.02
Mistrustfully02and02with02an02affectation02of02being02alarmed02and02
CHAPTER02V0202
almost02affronted,02he02scanned02Raskolnikov's02low02and02
narrow02"cabin."02With02the02same02amazement02he02stared02at02
Raskolnikov,02who02lay02undressed,02dishevelled,02unwashed,02
on02his02miserable02dirty02sofa,02looking02fixedly02at02him.02Then02
with02the02same02deliberation02he02scrutinised02the02uncouth,02
unkempt02figure02and02unshaven02face02of02Razumihin,02who02
looked02him02boldly02and02inquiringly02in02the02face02without02
rising02from02his02seat.02A02constrained02silence02lasted02for02a02
couple02of02minutes,02and02then,02as02might02be02expected,02some02
from02
scene\shifting02 took02 place.02 Reflecting,02 probably02
certain02fairly02unmistakable02signs,02that02he02would02get02
nothing02in02this02"cabin"02by02attempting02to02overawe02them,02the02
gentleman02softened02somewhat,02and02civilly,02though02with02
some02severity,02emphasising02every02syllable02of02his02question,02
addressed02Zossimov:0202
"Rodion02 Romanovitch02 Raskolnikov,02 a02 student,02 or02
formerly02a02student?"0202
Zossimov02made02a02slight02movement,02and02would02have02
answered,02had02not02Razumihin02anticipated02him.0202
"Here02he02is02lying02on02the02sofa!02What02do02you02want?"0202
This02familiar02"what02do02you02want"02seemed02to02cut02the02
ground02from02the02feet02of02the02pompous02gentleman.02He02was02
turning02to02Razumihin,02but02checked02himself02in02time02and02
turned02to02Zossimov02again.0202
"This02is02Raskolnikov,"02mumbled02Zossimov,02nodding02
towards02him.02Then02he02gave02a02prolonged02yawn,02opening02his02
mouth02as02wide02as02possible.02Then02he02lazily02put02his02hand02into02
his02waistcoat\pocket,02pulled02out02a02huge02gold02watch02in02a02
round02hunter's02case,02opened02it,02looked02at02it02and02as02slowly02
and02lazily02proceeded02to02put02it02back.0202
Raskolnikov02himself02lay02without02speaking,02on02his02back,02
gazing02persistently,02though02without02understanding,02at02the02
stranger.02Now02that02his02face02was02turned02away02from02the02
strange02flower02on02the02paper,02it02was02extremely02pale02and02
wore02a02look02of02anguish,02as02though02he02had02just02undergone02
an02agonising02operation02or02just02been02taken02from02the02rack.02
But02 the02 new\comer02 gradually02 began02 to02 arouse02 his02
attention,02then02his02wonder,02then02suspicion02and02even02alarm.02
When02Zossimov02said02"This02is02Raskolnikov"02he02jumped02up02
quickly,02sat02on02the02sofa02and02with02an02almost02defiant,02but02
weak02and02breaking,02voice02articulated:0202
"Yes,02I02am02Raskolnikov!02What02do02you02want?"0202
and02 pronounced02
scrutinised02 him02
The02 visitor02
impressively:0202
"Pyotr02Petrovitch02Luzhin.02I02believe02I02have02reason02to02
hope02that02my02name02is02not02wholly02unknown02to02you?"0202
But02Raskolnikov,02who02had02expected02something02quite02
different,02gazed02blankly02and02dreamily02at02him,02making02no02
reply,02as02though02he02heard02the02name02of02Pyotr02Petrovitch02for02
the02first02time.0202
"Is02it02possible02that02you02can02up02to02the02present02have02
received02 no02
information?"02 asked02 Pyotr02 Petrovitch,02
somewhat02disconcerted.0202
In02reply02Raskolnikov02sank02languidly02back02on02the02pillow,02
put02his02hands02behind02his02head02and02gazed02at02the02ceiling.02A02
look02of02dismay02came02into02Luzhin's02face.02Zossimov02and02
Razumihin02stared02at02him02more02inquisitively02than02ever,02and02
at02last02he02showed02unmistakable02signs02of02embarrassment.0202
"I02had02presumed02and02calculated,"02he02faltered,02"that02a02
letter02posted02more02than02ten02days,02if02not02a02fortnight02ago..."0202
"I02say,02why02are02you02standing02in02the02doorway?"02
Razumihin02interrupted02suddenly.02"If02you've02something02to02
say,02sit02down.02Nastasya02and02you02are02so02crowded.02Nastasya,02
make02room.02Here's02a02chair,02thread02your02way02in!"0202
He02moved02his02chair02back02from02the02table,02made02a02little02
space02between02the02table02and02his02knees,02and02waited02in02a02

refuse,02and02the02visitor02squeezed02his02way02through,02hurrying02
and02stumbling.02Reaching02the02chair,02he02sat02down,02looking02
suspiciously02at02Razumihin.0202
"No02need02to02be02nervous,"02the02latter02blurted02out.02"Rodya02

"Thank02you.02But02shall02I02not02disturb02the02invalid02by02my02

Zossimov.0202
"N\no,"02mumbled02Zossimov;02"you02may02amuse02him."02He02
yawned02again.0202
"He02has02been02conscious02a02long02time,02since02the02morning,"02
went02on02Razumihin,02whose02familiarity02seemed02so02much02
like02unaffected02good\nature02that02Pyotr02Petrovitch02began02to02
be02more02cheerful,02partly,02perhaps,02because02this02shabby02and02
impudent02person02had02introduced02himself02as02a02student.0202
"Your02mamma,"02began02Luzhin.0202
"Hm!"02Razumihin02cleared02his02throat02loudly.02Luzhin02
looked02at02him02inquiringly.0202
"That's02all02right,02go02on."0202
Luzhin02shrugged02his02shoulders.0202
"Your02mamma02had02commenced02a02letter02to02you02while02I02

astonishment..."0202
"I02know,02I02know!"02Raskolnikov02cried02suddenly02with02
impatient02vexation.02"So02you02are02the02 fiancé?02I02know,02and02
that's02enough!"0202
There02was02no02doubt02about02Pyotr02Petrovitch's02being02
offended02this02time,02but02he02said02nothing.02He02made02a02violent02
effort02to02understand02what02it02all02meant.02There02was02a02
moment's02silence.0202
Meanwhile02 Raskolnikov,02 who02 had02 turned02 a02
little02
towards02him02when02he02answered,02began02suddenly02staring02
at02him02again02with02marked02curiosity,02as02though02he02had02not02
had02a02good02look02at02him02yet,02or02as02though02something02new02
had02struck02him;02he02rose02from02his02pillow02on02purpose02to02
stare02at02him.02There02certainly02was02something02peculiar02in02
Pyotr02Petrovitch's02whole02appearance,02something02which02
seemed02to02justify02the02title02of02"fiancé"02so02unceremoniously02
applied02to02him.02In02the02first02place,02it02was02evident,02far02too02
much02so02indeed,02that02Pyotr02Petrovitch02had02made02eager02use02
of02his02few02days02in02the02capital02to02get02himself02up02and02rig02
himself02out02in02expectation02of02his02betrothed―a02perfectly02
innocent02and02permissible02proceeding,02indeed.02Even02his02
own,02perhaps02too02complacent,02consciousness02of02the02
agreeable02improvement02in02his02appearance02might02have02
been02forgiven02in02such02circumstances,02seeing02that02Pyotr02
Petrovitch02had02taken02up02the02r00le02of02fiancé.02All02his02clothes02
were02fresh02from02the02tailor's02and02were02all02right,02except02for02
being02too02new02and02too02distinctly02appropriate.02Even02the02
stylish02new02round02hat02had02the02same02significance.02Pyotr02
Petrovitch02treated02it02too02respectfully02and02held02it02too02
carefully02in02his02hands.02The02exquisite02pair02of02lavender02
gloves,02real02Louvain,02told02the02same02tale,02if02only02from02the02
fact02of02his02not02wearing02them,02but02carrying02them02in02his02hand02
for02show.02Light02and02youthful02colours02predominated02in02
Pyotr02Petrovitch's02attire.02He02wore02a02charming02summer02

all02suited02Pyotr02Petrovitch.02His02very02fresh02and02even02
handsome02face02looked02younger02than02his02forty\five02years02at02
all02times.02His02dark,02mutton\chop02whiskers02made02an02
agreeable02setting02on02both02sides,02growing02thickly02upon02his02
shining,02clean\shaven02chin.02Even02his02hair,02touched02here02
and02there02with02grey,02though02it02had02been02combed02and02
curled02at02a02hairdresser's,02did02not02give02him02a02stupid02
appearance,02as02curled02hair02usually02does,02by02inevitably02
suggesting02a02German02on02his02wedding\day.02If02there02really02
was02something02unpleasing02and02repulsive02in02his02rather02
good\looking02and02imposing02countenance,02it02was02due02to02
quite02 other02
scanning02 Mr.02 Luzhin02
unceremoniously,02Raskolnikov02smiled02malignantly,02sank02
back02on02the02pillow02and02stared02at02the02ceiling02as02before.0202
But02Mr.02Luzhin02hardened02his02heart02and02seemed02to02
determine02to02take02no02notice02of02their02oddities.0202
"I02feel02the02greatest02regret02at02finding02you02in02this02
situation,"02he02began,02again02breaking02the02silence02with02an02
effort.02"If02I02had02been02aware02of02your02illness02I02should02have02

expecting02your02mamma02and02sister02any02minute."0202
Raskolnikov02made02a02movement02and02seemed02about02to02
speak;02his02face02showed02some02excitement.02Pyotr02Petrovitch02
paused,02waited,02but02as02nothing02followed,02he02went02on:0202
"...02Any02minute.02I02have02found02a02lodging02for02them02on02their02
arrival."0202
"Where?"02asked02Raskolnikov02weakly.0202
"Very02near02here,02in02Bakaleyev's02house."0202
"That's02in02Voskresensky,"02put02in02Razumihin.02"There02are02
two02storeys02of02rooms,02let02by02a02merchant02called02Yushin;02I've02
been02there."0202
"Yes,02rooms..."0202
"A02disgusting02place―filthy,02stinking02and,02what's02more,02
of02doubtful02character.02Things02have02happened02there,02and02
there02are02all02sorts02of02queer02people02living02there.02And02I02went02
there02about02a02scandalous02business.02It's02cheap,02though..."0202
"I02could02not,02of02course,02find02out02so02much02about02it,02for02I02

replied02huffily.02"However,02the02two02rooms02are02exceedingly02

"Lebeziatnikov?"02 said02 Raskolnikov02 slowly,02 as02
if02
recalling02something.0202
"Yes,02Andrey02Semyonovitch02Lebeziatnikov,02a02clerk02in02
the02Ministry.02Do02you02know02him?"0202
"Yes...02no,"02Raskolnikov02answered.0202
"Excuse02me,02I02fancied02so02from02your02inquiry.02I02was02once02

Luzhin02looked02round02hopefully02at02them02all.0202
"How02do02you02mean?"02asked02Razumihin.0202
"In02the02most02serious02and02essential02matters,"02Pyotr02
Petrovitch02replied,02as02though02delighted02at02the02question.02
"You02see,02it's02ten02years02since02I02visited02Petersburg.02All02the02

"At02what?"0202
"Your02question02is02a02wide02one.02I02may02be02mistaken,02but02I02
fancy02I02find02clearer02views,02more,02so02to02say,02criticism,02more02
practicality..."0202
"That's02true,"02Zossimov02let02drop.0202
"Nonsense!02There's02no02practicality."02Razumihin02flew02at02
him.02"Practicality02is02a02difficult02thing02to02find;02it02does02not02
drop02down02from02heaven.02And02for02the02last02two02hundred02

well02shod."0202
"I02don't02agree02with02you,"02Pyotr02Petrovitch02replied,02with02
evident02enjoyment.02"Of02course,02people02do02get02carried02away02

"He's02learnt02it02by02heart02to02show02off!"02Raskolnikov02
pronounced02suddenly.0202
a02
"What?"02asked02Pyotr02Petrovitch,02not02catching02his02
words;02but02he02received02no02reply.0202
"That's02all02true,"02Zossimov02hastened02to02interpose.0202
"Isn't02it02so?"02Pyotr02Petrovitch02went02on,02glancing02affably02
at02Zossimov.02"You02must02admit,"02he02went02on,02addressing02
and02
triumph02
of02
shade02
Razumihin02 with02
superciliousness―he02almost02added02"young02man"―"that02

Raskolnikov02 did02 not02 even02 turn02 his02 head.02 Pyotr02

"Yes.02What02then?"0202
"Nothing."0202
"How02does02he02get02hold02of02them?"02asked02Zossimov.0202

Raskolnikov,02left02alone,02looked02with02impatience02and02
misery02at02Nastasya,02but02she02still02lingered.0202
"Won't02you02have02some02tea02now?"02she02asked.0202
"Later!02I02am02sleepy!02Leave02me."0202
He02turned02abruptly02to02the02wall;02Nastasya02went02out.0202
02
0202
But02as02soon02as02she02went02out,02he02got02up,02latched02the02
door,02undid02the02parcel02which02Razumihin02had02brought02in02
that02evening02and02had02tied02up02again02and02began02dressing.02
Strange02to02say,02he02seemed02immediately02to02have02become02
perfectly02calm;02not02a02trace02of02his02recent02delirium02nor02of02the02
panic02fear02that02had02haunted02him02of02late.02It02was02the02first02
moment02of02a02strange02sudden02calm.02His02movements02were02
precise02and02definite;02a02firm02purpose02was02evident02in02them.02
"To\day,02to\day,"02he02muttered02to02himself.02He02understood02
that02 he02 was02 still02 weak,02 but02 his02
intense02 spiritual02
concentration02gave02him02strength02and02self\confidence.02He02
hoped,02moreover,02that02he02would02not02fall02down02in02the02street.02
When02he02had02dressed02in02entirely02new02clothes,02he02looked02at02
the02money02lying02on02the02table,02and02after02a02moment's02
thought02put02it02in02his02pocket.02It02was02twenty\five02roubles.02He02
took02also02all02the02copper02change02from02the02ten02roubles02spent02
by02Razumihin02on02the02clothes.02Then02he02softly02unlatched02the02
door,02went02out,02slipped02downstairs02and02glanced02in02at02the02
open02kitchen02door.02Nastasya02was02standing02with02her02back02to02
him,02blowing02up02the02landlady's02samovar.02She02heard02
nothing.02Who02would02have02dreamed02of02his02going02out,02
indeed?02A02minute02later02he02was02in02the02street.0202
It02was02nearly02eight02o'clock,02the02sun02was02setting.02It02was02
as02stifling02as02before,02but02he02eagerly02drank02in02the02stinking,02
dusty02town02air.02His02head02felt02rather02dizzy;02a02sort02of02savage02
energy02gleamed02suddenly02in02his02feverish02eyes02and02his02
wasted,02pale02and02yellow02face.02He02did02not02know02and02did02not02
think02where02he02was02going,02he02had02one02thought02only:02"that02
all02 this02must02be02ended02to\day,02once02for02all,02immediately;02
that02he02would02not02return02home02without02it,02because02he02
would02not02go02on02living02like02that."02How,02with02what02to02make02
an02end?02He02had02not02an02idea02about02it,02he02did02not02even02want02
to02think02of02it.02He02drove02away02thought;02thought02tortured02
him.02All02he02knew,02all02he02felt02was02that02everything02must02be02
changed02"one02way02or02another,"02he02repeated02with02desperate02
and02immovable02self\confidence02and02determination.0202
From02old02habit02he02took02his02usual02walk02in02the02direction02
of02the02Hay02Market.02A02dark\haired02young02man02with02a02barrel02
organ02was02standing02in02the02road02in02front02of02a02little02general02
shop02and02was02grinding02out02a02very02sentimental02song.02He02
was02accompanying02a02girl02of02fifteen,02who02stood02on02the02
pavement02in02front02of02him.02She02was02dressed02up02in02a02
crinoline,02a02mantle02and02a02straw02hat02with02a02flame\coloured02
feather02in02it,02all02very02old02and02shabby.02In02a02strong02and02rather02
agreeable02voice,02cracked02and02coarsened02by02street02singing,02
she02sang02in02hope02of02getting02a02copper02from02the02shop.02
Raskolnikov02joined02two02or02three02listeners,02took02out02a02five02
copeck02piece02and02put02it02in02the02girl's02hand.02She02broke02off02
abruptly02on02a02sentimental02high02note,02shouted02sharply02to02
the02organ02grinder02"Come02on,"02and02both02moved02on02to02the02
next02shop.0202
"Do02 you02
like02 street02 music?"02 said02 Raskolnikov,02
addressing02a02middle\aged02man02standing02idly02by02him.02The02
man02looked02at02him,02startled02and02wondering.0202
"I02love02to02hear02singing02to02a02street02organ,"02said02
Raskolnikov,02and02his02manner02seemed02strangely02out02of02
keeping02with02the02subject―"I02like02it02on02cold,02dark,02damp02
autumn02evenings―they02must02be02damp―when02all02the02

when02wet02snow02is02falling02straight02down,02when02there's02no02

shine02through02it..."0202
"I02don't02know....02Excuse02me..."02muttered02the02stranger,02
frightened02by02the02question02and02Raskolnikov's02strange02
manner,02and02he02crossed02over02to02the02other02side02of02the02
street.0202Raskolnikov02walked02straight02on02and02came02out02at02the02
corner02of02the02Hay02Market,02where02the02huckster02and02his02wife02
had02talked02with02Lizaveta;02but02they02were02not02there02now.02
Recognising02the02place,02he02stopped,02looked02round02and02
addressed02a02young02fellow02in02a02red02shirt02who02stood02gaping02
before02a02corn02chandler's02shop.0202
"Isn't02there02a02man02who02keeps02a02booth02with02his02wife02at02
this02corner?"0202
"All02sorts02of02people02keep02booths02here,"02answered02the02
young02man,02glancing02superciliously02at02Raskolnikov.0202
"What's02his02name?"0202
"What02he02was02christened."0202
"Aren't02you02a02Zara07sky02man,02too?02Which02province?"0202
The02young02man02looked02at02Raskolnikov02again.0202
"It's02not02a02province,02your02excellency,02but02a02district.02
Graciously02forgive02me,02your02excellency!"0202
"Is02that02a02tavern02at02the02top02there?"0202
"Yes,02it's02an02eating\house02and02there's02a02billiard\room02
and02you'll02find02princesses02there02too....02La\la!"0202
Raskolnikov02crossed02the02square.02In02that02corner02there02
was02a02dense02crowd02of02peasants.02He02pushed02his02way02into02
the02thickest02part02of02it,02looking02at02the02faces.02He02felt02an02
unaccountable02inclination02to02enter02into02conversation02with02
people.02But02the02peasants02took02no02notice02of02him;02they02were02
all02shouting02in02groups02together.02He02stood02and02thought02a02
little02and02took02a02turning02to02the02right02in02the02direction02of02V.0202
He02had02often02crossed02that02little02street02which02turns02at02an02
angle,02leading02from02the02market\place02to02Sadovy02Street.02Of02
late02he02had02often02felt02drawn02to02wander02about02this02district,02
when02he02felt02depressed,02that02he02might02feel02more02so.0202
Now02he02walked02along,02thinking02of02nothing.02At02that02point02
there02is02a02great02block02of02buildings,02entirely02let02out02in02dram02
shops02 and02 eating\houses;02 women02 were02 continually02
running02in02and02out,02bare\headed02and02in02their02indoor02
clothes.02Here02and02there02they02gathered02in02groups,02on02the02
pavement,02especially02about02the02entrances02to02various02
festive02establishments02in02the02lower02storeys.02From02one02of02
these02a02loud02din,02sounds02of02singing,02the02tinkling02of02a02guitar02
and02shouts02of02merriment,02floated02into02the02street.02A02crowd02
of02women02were02thronging02round02the02door;02some02were02
sitting02on02the02steps,02others02on02the02pavement,02others02were02
standing02talking.02A02drunken02soldier,02smoking02a02cigarette,02
was02walking02near02them02in02the02road,02swearing;02he02seemed02
to02be02trying02to02find02his02way02somewhere,02but02had02forgotten02
where.02One02beggar02was02quarrelling02with02another,02and02a02
man02 dead02 drunk02 was02
lying02 right02 across02 the02 road.02
Raskolnikov02joined02the02throng02of02women,02who02were02
talking02in02husky02voices.02They02were02bare\headed02and02wore02
cotton02dresses02and02goatskin02shoes.02There02were02women02of02
forty02and02some02not02more02than02seventeen;02almost02all02had02
blackened02eyes.0202
He02felt02strangely02attracted02by02the02singing02and02all02the02
noise02and02uproar02in02the02saloon02below....02someone02could02be02
heard02within02dancing02frantically,02marking02time02with02his02
heels02to02the02sounds02of02the02guitar02and02of02a02thin02falsetto02voice02
singing02a02jaunty02air.02He02listened02intently,02gloomily02and02
dreamily,02bending02down02at02the02entrance02and02peeping02
inquisitively02in02from02the02pavement.0202
"Oh,02my02handsome02soldier02Don't02beat02me02for02nothing,"0202
trilled02the02thin02voice02of02the02singer.02Raskolnikov02felt02a02
great02desire02to02make02out02what02he02was02singing,02as02though02
everything02depended02on02that.0202
"Shall02I02go02in?"02he02thought.02"They02are02laughing.02From02
drink.02Shall02I02get02drunk?"0202
"Won't02you02come02in?"02one02of02the02women02asked02him.02Her02
voice02was02still02musical02and02less02thick02than02the02others,02she02
was02young02and02not02repulsive―the02only02one02of02the02group.0202
"Why,02she's02pretty,"02he02said,02drawing02himself02up02and02
looking02at02her.0202
She02smiled,02much02pleased02at02the02compliment.0202
"You're02very02nice02looking02yourself,"02she02said.0202
"Isn't02he02thin02though!"02observed02another02woman02in02a02
deep02bass.02"Have02you02just02come02out02of02a02hospital?"0202
"They're02all02generals'02daughters,02it02seems,02but02they02have02
all02snub02noses,"02interposed02a02tipsy02peasant02with02a02sly02smile02
on02his02face,02wearing02a02loose02coat.02"See02how02jolly02they02are."0202
"Go02along02with02you!"0202
"I'll02go,02sweetie!"0202
the02 saloon02 below.02
And02 he02 darted02 down02
into02
Raskolnikov02moved02on.0202
"I02say,02sir,"02the02girl02shouted02after02him.0202
"What02is02it?"0202
She02hesitated.0202
"I'll02always02be02pleased02to02spend02an02hour02with02you,02kind02
gentleman,02but02now02I02feel02shy.02Give02me02six02copecks02for02a02
drink,02there's02a02nice02young02man!"0202
Raskolnikov02gave02her02what02came02first―fifteen02copecks.0202
"Ah,02what02a02good\natured02gentleman!"0202
"What's02your02name?"0202
"Ask02for02Duclida."0202
"Well,02that's02too02much,"02one02of02the02women02observed,02
shaking02her02head02at02Duclida.02"I02don't02know02how02you02can02
ask02like02that.02I02believe02I02should02drop02with02shame...."0202
Raskolnikov02looked02curiously02at02the02speaker.02She02was02a02
pock\marked02wench02of02thirty,02covered02with02bruises,02with02
her02upper02lip02swollen.02She02made02her02criticism02quietly02and02
earnestly.02"Where02is02it,"02thought02Raskolnikov.02"Where02is02it02
I've02read02that02someone02condemned02to02death02says02or02thinks,02

added02a02moment02later.0202
He02went02into02another02street.02"Bah,02the02Palais02de02Cristal!02
Razumihin02was02just02talking02of02the02Palais02de02Cristal.02But02
what02on02earth02was02it02I02wanted?02Yes,02the02newspapers....02
Zossimov02said02he'd02read02it02in02the02papers.02Have02you02the02

positively02clean02restaurant,02consisting02of02several02rooms,02
which02were,02however,02rather02empty.02Two02or02three02people02
were02drinking02tea,02and02in02a02room02further02away02were02sitting02
four02men02drinking02champagne.02Raskolnikov02fancied02that02
Zametov02was02one02of02them,02but02he02could02not02be02sure02at02that02
distance.02"What02if02it02is?"02he02thought.0202
"Will02you02have02vodka?"02asked02the02waiter.0202
"Give02me02some02tea02and02bring02me02the02papers,02the02old02

"Yes,02sir,02here's02to\day's.02No02vodka?"0202
The02 old02 newspapers02 and02 the02 tea02 were02 brought.02
Raskolnikov02sat02down02and02began02to02look02through02them.0202
"Oh,02damn...02these02are02the02items02of02intelligence.02An02

all02and02began02eagerly02seeking02later02additions02in02the02
following02 numbers.02 His02 hands02 shook02 with02 nervous02
impatience02as02he02turned02the02sheets.02Suddenly02someone02sat02
down02beside02him02at02his02table.02He02looked02up,02it02was02the02
head02clerk02Zametov,02looking02just02the02same,02with02the02rings02
on02his02fingers02and02the02watch\chain,02with02the02curly,02black02
hair,02parted02and02pomaded,02with02the02smart02waistcoat,02
rather02shabby02coat02and02doubtful02linen.02He02was02in02a02good02
humour,02at02least02he02was02smiling02very02gaily02and02good\
humouredly.02His02dark02face02was02rather02flushed02from02the02
champagne02he02had02drunk.0202
"What,02you02here?"02he02began02in02surprise,02speaking02as02
though02he'd02known02him02all02his02life.02"Why,02Razumihin02told02
me02only02yesterday02you02were02unconscious.02How02strange!02
And02do02you02know02I've02been02to02see02you?"0202
Raskolnikov02knew02he02would02come02up02to02him.02He02laid02
aside02the02papers02and02turned02to02Zametov.02There02was02a02
smile02on02his02lips,02and02a02new02shade02of02irritable02impatience02
was02apparent02in02that02smile.0202
"I02know02you02have,"02he02answered.02"I've02heard02it.02You02
looked02for02my02sock....02And02you02know02Razumihin02has02lost02
his02heart02to02you?02He02says02you've02been02with02him02to02Luise02
Ivanovna's―you02know,02the02woman02you02tried02to02befriend,02
for02whom02you02winked02to02the02Explosive02Lieutenant02and02he02
would02not02understand.02Do02you02remember?02How02could02he02
fail02to02understand―it02was02quite02clear,02wasn't02it?"0202
"What02a02hot02head02he02is!"0202
"The02explosive02one?"0202
"No,02your02friend02Razumihin."0202
"You02must02have02a02jolly02life,02Mr.02Zametov;02entrance02free02
to02 the02 most02 agreeable02 places.02 Who's02 been02 pouring02
champagne02into02you02just02now?"0202
"We've02just02been...02having02a02drink02together....02You02talk02
about02pouring02it02into02me!"0202
"By02 way02 of02 a02

Raskolnikov02laughed,02"it's02all02right,02my02dear02boy,"02he02
added,02slapping02Zametov02on02the02shoulder.02"I02am02not02

"How02do02you02know02about02it?"0202
"Perhaps02I02know02more02about02it02than02you02do."0202
"How02strange02you02are....02I02am02sure02you02are02still02very02
unwell.02You02oughtn't02to02have02come02out."0202
"Oh,02do02I02seem02strange02to02you?"0202
"Yes.02What02are02you02doing,02reading02the02papers?"0202
"Yes."0202
"There's02a02lot02about02the02fires."0202
"No,02I02am02not02reading02about02the02fires."02Here02he02looked02
mysteriously02at02Zametov;02his02lips02were02twisted02again02in02a02
mocking02smile.02"No,02I02am02not02reading02about02the02fires,"02he02
went02on,02winking02at02Zametov.02"But02confess02now,02my02dear02
fellow,02you're02awfully02anxious02to02know02what02I02am02reading02
about?"0202
"I02am02not02in02the02least.02Mayn't02I02ask02a02question?02Why02do02
you02keep02on...?"0202
"Listen,02you02are02a02man02of02culture02and02education?"0202
"I02was02in02the02sixth02class02at02the02gymnasium,"02said02
Zametov02with02some02dignity.0202
"Sixth02class!02Ah,02my02cock\sparrow!02With02your02parting02
and02your02rings―you02are02a02gentleman02of02fortune.02Foo!02what02
a02charming02boy!"02Here02Raskolnikov02broke02into02a02nervous02
laugh02right02in02Zametov's02face.02The02latter02drew02back,02more02
amazed02than02offended.0202
"Foo!02how02strange02you02are!"02Zametov02repeated02very02
seriously.02"I02can't02help02thinking02you02are02still02delirious."0202
"I02am02delirious?02You02are02fibbing,02my02cock\sparrow!02So02I02
am02strange?02You02find02me02curious,02do02you?"0202
"Yes,02curious."0202
"Shall02I02tell02you02what02I02was02reading02about,02what02I02was02

"Well,02what02is02it?"0202
"You02prick02up02your02ears?"0202
"How02do02you02mean―'prick02up02my02ears'?"0202
"I'll02explain02that02afterwards,02but02now,02my02boy,02I02declare02

up02his02eyes02and02paused.02"I02was02searching―and02came02here02
on02purpose02to02do02it―for02news02of02the02murder02of02the02old02

pawnbroker02woman,"02he02articulated02at02last,02almost02in02a02
whisper,02bringing02his02face02exceedingly02close02to02the02face02of02
Zametov.02Zametov02looked02at02him02steadily,02without02moving02
or02 drawing02 his02
face02 away.02 What02 struck02 Zametov02
afterwards02as02the02strangest02part02of02it02all02was02that02silence02
followed02for02exactly02a02minute,02and02that02they02gazed02at02one02
another02all02the02while.0202
"What02if02you02have02been02reading02about02it?"02he02cried02at02
last,02perplexed02and02impatient.02"That's02no02business02of02mine!02
What02of02it?"0202
"The02same02old02woman,"02Raskolnikov02went02on02in02the02
same02whisper,02not02heeding02Zametov's02explanation,02"about02
whom02 you02 were02
the02 police\office,02 you02
talking02
remember,02when02I02fainted.02Well,02do02you02understand02now?"0202
"What02do02you02mean?02Understand...02what?"02Zametov02
brought02out,02almost02alarmed.0202
Raskolnikov's02set02and02earnest02face02was02suddenly02
transformed,02and02he02suddenly02went02off02into02the02same02
nervous02laugh02as02before,02as02though02utterly02unable02to02
restrain02himself.02And02in02one02flash02he02recalled02with02
extraordinary02vividness02of02sensation02a02moment02in02the02
recent02past,02that02moment02when02he02stood02with02the02axe02
behind02the02door,02while02the02latch02trembled02and02the02men02
outside02swore02and02shook02it,02and02he02had02a02sudden02desire02to02
shout02at02them,02to02swear02at02them,02to02put02out02his02tongue02at02
them,02to02mock02them,02to02laugh,02and02laugh,02and02laugh!0202
"You02are02either02mad,02or..."02began02Zametov,02and02he02broke02
off,02as02though02stunned02by02the02idea02that02had02suddenly02
flashed02into02his02mind.0202
"Or?02Or02what?02What?02Come,02tell02me!"0202
"Nothing,"02 said02 Zametov,02 getting02 angry,02 "it's02 all02
nonsense!"0202
Both02were02silent.02After02his02sudden02fit02of02laughter02
Raskolnikov02became02suddenly02thoughtful02and02melancholy.02
He02put02his02elbow02on02the02table02and02leaned02his02head02on02his02
hand.02He02seemed02to02have02completely02forgotten02Zametov.02
The02silence02lasted02for02some02time.0202
"Why02don't02you02drink02your02tea?02It's02getting02cold,"02said02
Zametov.0202
"What!02Tea?02Oh,02yes...."02Raskolnikov02sipped02the02glass,02
put02a02morsel02of02bread02in02his02mouth02and,02suddenly02looking02
at02Zametov,02seemed02to02remember02everything02and02pulled02
himself02together.02At02the02same02moment02his02face02resumed02its02
original02mocking02expression.02He02went02on02drinking02tea.0202
"There02have02been02a02great02many02of02these02crimes02lately,"02
said02Zametov.02"Only02the02other02day02I02read02in02the02 Moscow02

"Oh,02but02it02was02a02long02time02ago!02I02read02about02it02a02month02

"Of02course02they02are02criminals."0202
"They?02They02are02children,02simpletons,02not02criminals!02

did02not02know02how02to02change02the02notes02either;02the02man02who02
changed02the02notes02took02five02thousand02roubles,02and02his02
hands02trembled.02He02counted02the02first02four02thousand,02but02
did02not02count02the02fifth02thousand―he02was02in02such02a02hurry02
to02get02the02money02into02his02pocket02and02run02away.02Of02course02
he02roused02suspicion.02And02the02whole02thing02came02to02a02crash02
through02one02fool!02Is02it02possible?"0202
"That02his02hands02trembled?"02observed02Zametov,02"yes,02
that's02quite02possible.02That,02I02feel02quite02sure,02is02possible.02
Sometimes02one02can't02stand02things."0202
"Can't02stand02that?"0202
"Why,02could02you02stand02it02then?02No,02I02couldn't.02For02the02

Raskolnikov02had02an02intense02desire02again02"to02put02his02
tongue02out."02Shivers02kept02running02down02his02spine.0202
"I02should02do02it02quite02differently,"02Raskolnikov02began.02
"This02is02how02I02would02change02the02notes:02I'd02count02the02first02

"Foo!02what02terrible02things02you02say!"02said02Zametov,02
laughing.02"But02all02that02is02only02talk.02I02dare02say02when02it02came02

Raskolnikov02seemed02offended.0202
"Clear?02Why02don't02you02catch02him02then?"02he02cried,02
maliciously02gibing02at02Zametov.0202
"Well,02they02will02catch02him."0202
"Who?02You?02Do02you02suppose02you02could02catch02him?02
You've02a02tough02job!02A02great02point02for02you02is02whether02a02man02

"The02fact02is02they02always02do02that,02though,"02answered02
Zametov.02"A02man02will02commit02a02clever02murder02at02the02risk02

Raskolnikov02frowned02and02looked02steadily02at02Zametov.0202
"You02seem02to02enjoy02the02subject02and02would02like02to02know02
how02I02should02behave02in02that02case,02too?"02he02asked02with02
displeasure.0202
"I02should02like02to,"02Zametov02answered02firmly02and02
seriously.02Somewhat02too02much02earnestness02began02to02
appear02in02his02words02and02looks.0202
"Very02much?"0202
"Very02much!"0202
"All02 right02 then.02 This02
is02 how02 I02 should02 behave,"02
Raskolnikov02began,02again02bringing02his02face02close02to02
Zametov's,02again02staring02at02him02and02speaking02in02a02whisper,02
so02that02the02latter02positively02shuddered.02"This02is02what02I02
should02have02done.02I02should02have02taken02the02money02and02

And,02well,02they02could02search!02There'd02be02no02trace."0202
"You02are02a02madman,"02said02Zametov,02and02for02some02
reason02he02too02spoke02in02a02whisper,02and02moved02away02from02
Raskolnikov,02whose02eyes02were02glittering.02He02had02turned02
fearfully02pale02and02his02upper02lip02was02twitching02and02
quivering.02He02bent02down02as02close02as02possible02to02Zametov,02
and02his02lips02began02to02move02without02uttering02a02word.02This02
lasted02for02half02a02minute;02he02knew02what02he02was02doing,02but02
could02not02restrain02himself.02The02terrible02word02trembled02on02
his02lips,02like02the02latch02on02that02door;02in02another02moment02it02
will02break02out,02in02another02moment02he02will02let02it02go,02he02will02
speak02out.0202
"And02what02if02it02was02I02who02murdered02the02old02woman02and02
Lizaveta?"02he02said02suddenly02and―realised02what02he02had02
done.0202Zametov02looked02wildly02at02him02and02turned02white02as02the02
tablecloth.02His02face02wore02a02contorted02smile.0202
"But02is02it02possible?"02he02brought02out02faintly.02Raskolnikov02
looked02wrathfully02at02him.0202
"Own02up02that02you02believed02it,02yes,02you02did?"0202
"Not02a02bit02of02it,02I02believe02it02less02than02ever02now,"02Zametov02
cried02hastily.0202
"I've02caught02my02cock\sparrow!02So02you02did02believe02it02
before,02if02now02you02believe02less02than02ever?"0202
"Not02at02all,"02cried02Zametov,02obviously02embarrassed.02
"Have02you02been02frightening02me02so02as02to02lead02up02to02this?"0202
"You02don't02believe02it02then?02What02were02you02talking02
about02behind02my02back02when02I02went02out02of02the02police\
office?02And02why02did02the02explosive02lieutenant02question02me02
after02I02fainted?02Hey,02there,"02he02shouted02to02the02waiter,02
getting02up02and02taking02his02cap,02"how02much?"0202
"Thirty02copecks,"02the02latter02replied,02running02up.0202
"And02there02is02twenty02copecks02for02vodka.02See02what02a02lot02
of02money!"02he02held02out02his02shaking02hand02to02Zametov02with02
notes02in02it.02"Red02notes02and02blue,02twenty\five02roubles.02

Assez02causé!02Till02we02meet02again!"0202
He02went02out,02trembling02all02over02from02a02sort02of02wild02
hysterical02sensation,02in02which02there02was02an02element02of02
insufferable02rapture.02Yet02he02was02gloomy02and02terribly02tired.02
His02face02was02twisted02as02after02a02fit.02His02fatigue02increased02
rapidly.02Any02shock,02any02irritating02sensation02stimulated02and02
revived02his02energies02at02once,02but02his02strength02failed02as02
quickly02when02the02stimulus02was02removed.0202
Zametov,02left02alone,02sat02for02a02long02time02in02the02same02
place,02plunged02in02thought.02Raskolnikov02had02unwittingly02
worked02a02revolution02in02his02brain02on02a02certain02point02and02
had02made02up02his02mind02for02him02conclusively.0202
"Ilya02Petrovitch02is02a02blockhead,"02he02decided.0202
Raskolnikov02had02hardly02opened02the02door02of02the02
restaurant02when02he02stumbled02against02Razumihin02on02the02
steps.02They02did02not02see02each02other02till02they02almost02knocked02
against02each02other.02For02a02moment02they02stood02looking02each02
other02up02and02down.02Razumihin02was02greatly02astounded,02
then02anger,02real02anger02gleamed02fiercely02in02his02eyes.0202
"So02here02you02are!"02he02shouted02at02the02top02of02his02voice―
"you02ran02away02from02your02bed!02And02here02I've02been02looking02
for02you02under02the02sofa!02We02went02up02to02the02garret.02I02almost02

"It02means02that02I'm02sick02to02death02of02you02all02and02I02want02to02

"Alone?02When02you02are02not02able02to02walk,02when02your02face02
is02as02white02as02a02sheet02and02you02are02gasping02for02breath!02
Idiot!...02What02have02you02been02doing02in02the02Palais02de02Cristal?02
Own02up02at02once!"0202
"Let02me02go!"02said02Raskolnikov02and02tried02to02pass02him.02
This02was02too02much02for02Razumihin;02he02gripped02him02firmly02
by02the02shoulder.0202
"Let02you02go?02You02dare02tell02me02to02let02you02go?02Do02you02

"Listen,02 Razumihin,"02 Raskolnikov02 began02 quietly,02
apparently02calm―"can't02you02see02that02I02don't02want02your02

He02 began02 calmly,02 gloating02 beforehand02 over02 the02
venomous02phrases02he02was02about02to02utter,02but02finished,02
panting02for02breath,02in02a02frenzy,02as02he02had02been02with02Luzhin.0202
Razumihin02stood02a02moment,02thought02and02let02his02hand02
drop.0202"Well,02go02to02hell02then,"02he02said02gently02and02thoughtfully.02

to02know02you02if02you02don't!02Stay,02hey,02is02Zametov02in02there?"0202
"Yes."0202
"Did02you02see02him?"0202
"Yes."0202
"Talked02to02him?"0202
"Yes."0202
"What02about?02Confound02you,02don't02tell02me02then.02
Potchinkov's02house,0247,02Babushkin's02flat,02remember!"0202
Raskolnikov02walked02on02and02turned02the02corner02into02
Sadovy02Street.02Razumihin02looked02after02him02thoughtfully.02
Then02with02a02wave02of02his02hand02he02went02into02the02house02but02
stopped02short02of02the02stairs.0202
"Confound02it,"02he02went02on02almost02aloud.02"He02talked02
sensibly02but02yet...02I02am02a02fool!02As02if02madmen02didn't02talk02
sensibly!02And02this02was02just02what02Zossimov02seemed02afraid02
of."02He02struck02his02finger02on02his02forehead.02"What02if...02how02
could02I02let02him02go02off02alone?02He02may02drown02himself....02Ach,02
what02a02blunder!02I02can't."02And02he02ran02back02to02overtake02
Raskolnikov,02but02there02was02no02trace02of02him.02With02a02curse02
he02returned02with02rapid02steps02to02the02Palais02de02Cristal02to02
question02Zametov.0202
Raskolnikov02walked02straight02to02X――02Bridge,02stood02in02
the02middle,02and02leaning02both02elbows02on02the02rail02stared02into02
the02distance.02On02parting02with02Razumihin,02he02felt02so02much02
weaker02that02he02could02scarcely02reach02this02place.02He02longed02
to02sit02or02lie02down02somewhere02in02the02street.02Bending02over02
the02water,02he02gazed02mechanically02at02the02last02pink02flush02of02
the02sunset,02at02the02row02of02houses02growing02dark02in02the02
gathering02twilight,02at02one02distant02attic02window02on02the02left02
bank,02flashing02as02though02on02fire02in02the02last02rays02of02the02
setting02sun,02at02the02darkening02water02of02the02canal,02and02the02
water02seemed02to02catch02his02attention.02At02last02red02circles02
flashed02before02his02eyes,02the02houses02seemed02moving,02the02
passers\by,02the02canal02banks,02the02carriages,02all02danced02
before02his02eyes.02Suddenly02he02started,02saved02again02perhaps02
from02swooning02by02an02uncanny02and02hideous02sight.02He02
became02aware02of02someone02standing02on02the02right02side02of02
him;02he02looked02and02saw02a02tall02woman02with02a02kerchief02on02
her02head,02with02a02long,02yellow,02wasted02face02and02red02sunken02
eyes.02She02was02looking02straight02at02him,02but02obviously02she02
saw02nothing02and02recognised02no02one.02Suddenly02she02leaned02
her02right02hand02on02the02parapet,02lifted02her02right02leg02over02the02
railing,02then02her02left02and02threw02herself02into02the02canal.02The02
filthy02water02parted02and02swallowed02up02its02victim02for02a02
moment,02but02an02instant02later02the02drowning02woman02floated02
to02the02surface,02moving02slowly02with02the02current,02her02head02
and02legs02in02the02water,02her02skirt02inflated02like02a02balloon02over02
her02back.0202
"A02woman02drowning!02A02woman02drowning!"02shouted02
dozens02of02voices;02people02ran02up,02both02banks02were02thronged02
with02spectators,02on02the02bridge02people02crowded02about02
Raskolnikov,02pressing02up02behind02him.0202
"Mercy02on02it!02it's02our02Afrosinya!"02a02woman02cried02
tearfully02close02by.02"Mercy!02save02her!02kind02people,02pull02her02
out!"0202"A02boat,02a02boat"02was02shouted02in02the02crowd.02But02there02
was02no02need02of02a02boat;02a02policeman02ran02down02the02steps02to02
the02canal,02threw02off02his02great02coat02and02his02boots02and02
rushed02into02the02water.02It02was02easy02to02reach02her:02she02floated02
within02a02couple02of02yards02from02the02steps,02he02caught02hold02of02
her02clothes02with02his02right02hand02and02with02his02left02seized02a02
pole02which02a02comrade02held02out02to02him;02the02drowning02
woman02was02pulled02out02at02once.02They02laid02her02on02the02
granite02pavement02of02the02embankment.02She02soon02recovered02
consciousness,02raised02her02head,02sat02up02and02began02sneezing02
and02coughing,02stupidly02wiping02her02wet02dress02with02her02
hands.02She02said02nothing.0202
"She's02drunk02herself02out02of02her02senses,"02the02same02
woman's02voice02wailed02at02her02side.02"Out02of02her02senses.02The02
other02day02she02tried02to02hang02herself,02we02cut02her02down.02I02ran02
out02to02the02shop02just02now,02left02my02little02girl02to02look02after02
her―and02here02she's02in02trouble02again!02A02neighbour,02
gentleman,02a02neighbour,02we02live02close02by,02the02second02house02
from02the02end,02see02yonder...."0202
The02crowd02broke02up.02The02police02still02remained02round02
the02woman,02someone02mentioned02the02police02station....02
Raskolnikov02looked02on02with02a02strange02sensation02of02
indifference02and02apathy.02He02felt02disgusted.02"No,02that's02
loathsome...02water...02it's02not02good02enough,"02he02muttered02to02
himself.02"Nothing02will02come02of02it,"02he02added,02"no02use02to02
wait.02What02about02the02police02office...?02And02why02isn't02
Zametov02at02the02police02office?02The02police02office02is02open02till02
ten02o'clock...."02He02turned02his02back02to02the02railing02and02looked02
about02him.0202
"Very02well02then!"02he02said02resolutely;02he02moved02from02the02
bridge02and02walked02in02the02direction02of02the02police02office.02His02
heart02felt02hollow02and02empty.02He02did02not02want02to02think.02
Even02his02depression02had02passed,02there02was02not02a02trace02now02
of02the02energy02with02which02he02had02set02out02"to02make02an02end02of02
it02all."02Complete02apathy02had02succeeded02to02it.0202
"Well,02it's02a02way02out02of02it,"02he02thought,02walking02slowly02
and02listlessly02along02the02canal02bank.02"Anyway02I'll02make02an02
end,02for02I02want02to....02But02is02it02a02way02out?02What02does02it02
matter!02There'll02be02the02square02yard02of02space―ha!02But02what02
an02end!02Is02it02really02the02end?02Shall02I02tell02them02or02not?02Ah...02
damn!02How02tired02I02am!02If02I02could02find02somewhere02to02sit02or02
lie02down02soon!02What02I02am02most02ashamed02of02is02its02being02so02
stupid.02But02I02don't02care02about02that02either!02What02idiotic02
ideas02come02into02one's02head."0202
To02reach02the02police02office02he02had02to02go02straight02forward02
and02take02the02second02turning02to02the02left.02It02was02only02a02few02
paces02away.02But02at02the02first02turning02he02stopped02and,02after02a02
minute's02thought,02turned02into02a02side02street02and02went02two02
streets02out02of02his02way,02possibly02without02any02object,02or02
possibly02to02delay02a02minute02and02gain02time.02He02walked,02
looking02at02the02ground;02suddenly02someone02seemed02to02
whisper02in02his02ear;02he02lifted02his02head02and02saw02that02he02was02
standing02at02the02very02gate02of02the02house.02He02had02not02passed02
it,02he02had02not02been02near02it02since02 that02evening.02An02
overwhelming,02unaccountable02prompting02drew02him02on.02He02
went02into02the02house,02passed02through02the02gateway,02then02
into02the02first02entrance02on02the02right,02and02began02mounting02
the02familiar02staircase02to02the02fourth02storey.02The02narrow,02
steep02staircase02was02very02dark.02He02stopped02at02each02landing02
and02looked02round02him02with02curiosity;02on02the02first02landing02
the02framework02of02the02window02had02been02taken02out.02"That02
wasn't02so02then,"02he02thought.02Here02was02the02flat02on02the02
second02storey02where02Nikolay02and02Dmitri02had02been02
working.02"It's02shut02up02and02the02door02newly02painted.02So02it's02
to02let."02Then02the02third02storey02and02the02fourth.02"Here!"02He02
was02perplexed02to02find02the02door02of02the02flat02wide02open.02There02
were02men02there,02he02could02hear02voices;02he02had02not02expected02
that.02After02brief02hesitation02he02mounted02the02last02stairs02and02
went02into02the02flat.02It,02too,02was02being02done02up;02there02were02
workmen02in02it.02This02seemed02to02amaze02him;02he02somehow02
fancied02that02he02would02find02everything02as02he02left02it,02even02
perhaps02the02corpses02in02the02same02places02on02the02floor.02And02
now,02bare02walls,02no02furniture;02it02seemed02strange.02He02
walked02to02the02window02and02sat02down02on02the02window\sill.02
There02were02two02workmen,02both02young02fellows,02but02one02
much02younger02than02the02other.02They02were02papering02the02
walls02with02a02new02white02paper02covered02with02lilac02flowers,02
instead02of02the02old,02dirty,02yellow02one.02Raskolnikov02for02some02
reason02felt02horribly02annoyed02by02this.02He02looked02at02the02new02
paper02with02dislike,02as02though02he02felt02sorry02to02have02it02all02so02
changed.02The02workmen02had02obviously02stayed02beyond02their02
time02and02now02they02were02hurriedly02rolling02up02their02paper02
and02getting02ready02to02go02home.02They02took02no02notice02of02
Raskolnikov's02coming02in;02they02were02talking.02Raskolnikov02
folded02his02arms02and02listened.0202
"She02comes02to02me02in02the02morning,"02said02the02elder02to02the02
'Why02are02you02
younger,02"very02early,02all02dressed02up.02
preening02and02prinking?'02says02I.02'I02am02ready02to02do02anything02
to02please02you,02Tit02Vassilitch!'02That's02a02way02of02going02on!02And02
she02dressed02up02like02a02regular02fashion02book!"0202
"And02what02is02a02fashion02book?"02the02younger02one02asked.02
He02obviously02regarded02the02other02as02an02authority.0202
"A02fashion02book02is02a02lot02of02pictures,02coloured,02and02they02
come02to02the02tailors02here02every02Saturday,02by02post02from02
abroad,02to02show02folks02how02to02dress,02the02male02sex02as02well02as02
the02female.02They're02pictures.02The02gentlemen02are02generally02
wearing02fur02coats02and02for02the02ladies'02fluffles,02they're02
beyond02anything02you02can02fancy."0202
"There's02nothing02you02can't02find02in02Petersburg,"02the02
younger02cried02enthusiastically,02"except02father02and02mother,02
there's02everything!"0202
"Except02them,02there's02everything02to02be02found,02my02boy,"02
the02elder02declared02sententiously.0202
Raskolnikov02got02up02and02walked02into02the02other02room02
where02the02strong02box,02the02bed,02and02the02chest02of02drawers02
had02been;02the02room02seemed02to02him02very02tiny02without02
furniture02in02it.02The02paper02was02the02same;02the02paper02in02the02
corner02showed02where02the02case02of02ikons02had02stood.02He02
looked02at02it02and02went02to02the02window.02The02elder02workman02
looked02at02him02askance.0202
"What02do02you02want?"02he02asked02suddenly.0202
Instead02 of02 answering02 Raskolnikov02 went02
into02 the02
passage02and02pulled02the02bell.02The02same02bell,02the02same02
cracked02note.02He02rang02it02a02second02and02a02third02time;02he02
listened02and02remembered.02The02hideous02and02agonisingly02
fearful02sensation02he02had02felt02then02began02to02come02back02
more02and02more02vividly.02He02shuddered02at02every02ring02and02it02
gave02him02more02and02more02satisfaction.0202
"Well,02what02do02you02want?02Who02are02you?"02the02workman02
shouted,02going02out02to02him.02Raskolnikov02went02inside02again.0202
"I02want02to02take02a02flat,"02he02said.02"I02am02looking02round."0202
"It's02not02the02time02to02look02at02rooms02at02night!02and02you02
ought02to02come02up02with02the02porter."0202
"The02floors02have02been02washed,02will02they02be02painted?"02
Raskolnikov02went02on.02"Is02there02no02blood?"0202
"What02blood?"0202
"Why,02the02old02woman02and02her02sister02were02murdered02
here.02There02was02a02perfect02pool02there."0202
"But02who02are02you?"02the02workman02cried,02uneasy.0202
"Who02am02I?"0202
"Yes."0202
"You02want02to02know?02Come02to02the02police02station,02I'll02tell02
you."0202The02workmen02looked02at02him02in02amazement.0202
"It's02time02for02us02to02go,02we02are02late.02Come02along,02
Alyoshka.02We02must02lock02up,"02said02the02elder02workman.0202
"Very02well,02come02along,"02said02Raskolnikov02indifferently,02
and02going02out02first,02he02went02slowly02downstairs.02"Hey,02
porter,"02he02cried02in02the02gateway.0202
At02the02entrance02several02people02were02standing,02staring02
at02the02passers\by;02the02two02porters,02a02peasant02woman,02a02
man02in02a02long02coat02and02a02few02others.02Raskolnikov02went02
straight02up02to02them.0202
"What02do02you02want?"02asked02one02of02the02porters.0202
"Have02you02been02to02the02police02office?"0202
"I've02just02been02there.02What02do02you02want?"0202
"Is02it02open?"0202
"Of02course."0202
"Is02the02assistant02there?"0202
"He02was02there02for02a02time.02What02do02you02want?"0202
Raskolnikov02made02no02reply,02but02stood02beside02them02lost02
in02thought.0202
"He's02been02to02look02at02the02flat,"02said02the02elder02workman,02
coming02forward.0202
"Which02flat?"0202
"Where02we02are02at02work.02'Why02have02you02washed02away02
the02blood?'02says02he.02'There02has02been02a02murder02here,'02says02
he,02'and02I've02come02to02take02it.'02And02he02began02ringing02at02the02
bell,02all02but02broke02it.02'Come02to02the02police02station,'02says02he.02
'I'll02tell02you02everything02there.'02He02wouldn't02leave02us."0202
The02porter02
looked02at02Raskolnikov,02frowning02and02
perplexed.0202
"Who02are02you?"02he02shouted02as02impressively02as02he02could.0202
"I02am02Rodion02Romanovitch02Raskolnikov,02formerly02a02
student,02I02live02in02Shil's02house,02not02far02from02here,02flat02
Number0214,02ask02the02porter,02he02knows02me."02Raskolnikov02
said02all02this02in02a02lazy,02dreamy02voice,02not02turning02round,02but02
looking02intently02into02the02darkening02street.0202
"Why02have02you02been02to02the02flat?"0202
"To02look02at02it."0202
"What02is02there02to02look02at?"0202
"Take02him02straight02to02the02police02station,"02the02man02in02the02
long02coat02jerked02in02abruptly.0202
Raskolnikov02looked02intently02at02him02over02his02shoulder02
and02said02in02the02same02slow,02lazy02tones:0202
"Come02along."0202
"Yes,02take02him,"02the02man02went02on02more02confidently.02
"Why02was02he02going02into02that,02what's02in02his02mind,02eh?"0202
"He's02not02drunk,02but02God02knows02what's02the02matter02with02
him,"02muttered02the02workman.0202
"But02what02do02you02want?"02the02porter02shouted02again,02
beginning02to02get02angry02in02earnest―"Why02are02you02hanging02
about?"0202
"You02funk02the02police02station02then?"02said02Raskolnikov02
jeeringly.0202
"How02funk02it?02Why02are02you02hanging02about?"0202
"He's02a02rogue!"02shouted02the02peasant02woman.0202
"Why02waste02time02talking02to02him?"02cried02the02other02
porter,02a02huge02peasant02in02a02full02open02coat02and02with02keys02on02
his02belt.02"Get02along!02He02is02a02rogue02and02no02mistake.02Get02
along!"0202
And02seizing02Raskolnikov02by02the02shoulder02he02flung02him02
into02the02street.02He02lurched02forward,02but02recovered02his02
footing,02looked02at02the02spectators02in02silence02and02walked02
away.0202
"Strange02man!"02observed02the02workman.0202
"There02are02strange02folks02about02nowadays,"02said02the02
woman.0202
"You02should02have02taken02him02to02the02police02station02all02the02
same,"02said02the02man02in02the02long02coat.0202
"Better02have02nothing02to02do02with02him,"02decided02the02big02
porter.02"A02regular02rogue!02Just02what02he02wants,02you02may02be02
sure,02but02once02take02him02up,02you02won't02get02rid02of02him....02We02
know02the02sort!"0202
"Shall02I02go02there02or02not?"02thought02Raskolnikov,02standing02
in02the02middle02of02the02thoroughfare02at02the02cross\roads,02and02
he02looked02about02him,02as02though02expecting02from02someone02a02
decisive02word.02But02no02sound02came,02all02was02dead02and02silent02
like02the02stones02on02which02he02walked,02dead02to02him,02to02him02
alone....02All02at02once02at02the02end02of02the02street,02two02hundred02

CHAPTER02VII0202
"What02is02it?"02Raskolnikov02turned02to02the02right02and02went02up02
to02the02crowd.02He02seemed02to02clutch02at02everything02and02
smiled02coldly02when02he02recognised02it,02for02he02had02fully02made02
up02his02mind02to02go02to02the02police02station02and02knew02that02it02
would02all02soon02be02over.0202
02
0202
An02elegant02carriage02stood02in02the02middle02of02the02road02with02
a02pair02of02spirited02grey02horses;02there02was02no02one02in02it,02and02
the02coachman02had02got02off02his02box02and02stood02by;02the02horses02
were02being02held02by02the02bridle....02A02mass02of02people02had02
gathered02round,02the02police02standing02in02front.02One02of02them02
held02a02lighted02lantern02which02he02was02turning02on02something02
lying02close02to02the02wheels.02Everyone02was02talking,02shouting,02
exclaiming;02the02coachman02seemed02at02a02loss02and02kept02
repeating:0202
"What02a02misfortune!02Good02Lord,02what02a02misfortune!"0202
Raskolnikov02pushed02his02way02in02as02far02as02he02could,02and02
succeeded02at02last02in02seeing02the02object02of02the02commotion02
and02interest.02On02the02ground02a02man02who02had02been02run02over02
lay02apparently02unconscious,02and02covered02with02blood;02he02
was02very02badly02dressed,02but02not02like02a02workman.02Blood02
was02flowing02from02his02head02and02face;02his02face02was02crushed,02
mutilated02and02disfigured.02He02was02evidently02badly02injured.0202
"Merciful02heaven!"02wailed02the02coachman,02"what02more02
could02I02do?02If02I'd02been02driving02fast02or02had02not02shouted02to02
him,02but02I02was02going02quietly,02not02in02a02hurry.02Everyone02
could02see02I02was02going02along02just02like02everybody02else.02A02
drunken02man02can't02walk02straight,02we02all02know....02I02saw02him02
crossing02the02street,02staggering02and02almost02falling.02I02shouted02
again02and02a02second02and02a02third02time,02then02I02held02the02horses02
in,02but02he02fell02straight02under02their02feet!02Either02he02did02it02on02
purpose02or02he02was02very02tipsy....02The02horses02are02young02and02
ready02to02take02fright...02they02started,02he02screamed...02that02
made02them02worse.02That's02how02it02happened!"0202
"That's02just02how02it02was,"02a02voice02in02the02crowd02
confirmed.0202
"He02shouted,02that's02true,02he02shouted02three02times,"02
another02voice02declared.0202
"Three02times02it02was,02we02all02heard02it,"02shouted02a02third.0202
But02the02coachman02was02not02very02much02distressed02and02
frightened.02It02was02evident02that02the02carriage02belonged02to02a02
rich02 and02
important02 person02 who02 was02 awaiting02
it02
somewhere;02the02police,02of02course,02were02in02no02little02anxiety02
to02avoid02upsetting02his02arrangements.02All02they02had02to02do02
was02to02take02the02injured02man02to02the02police02station02and02the02
hospital.02No02one02knew02his02name.0202
Meanwhile02Raskolnikov02had02squeezed02in02and02stooped02
closer02over02him.02The02lantern02suddenly02lighted02up02the02
unfortunate02man's02face.02He02recognised02him.0202
"I02know02him!02I02know02him!"02he02shouted,02pushing02to02the02
front.02"It's02a02government02clerk02retired02from02the02service,02
Marmeladov.02He02lives02close02by02in02Kozel's02house....02Make02
haste02for02a02doctor!02I02will02pay,02see?"02He02pulled02money02out02of02
his02pocket02and02showed02it02to02the02policeman.02He02was02in02
violent02agitation.0202
The02police02were02glad02that02they02had02found02out02who02the02
man02was.02Raskolnikov02gave02his02own02name02and02address,02
and,02as02earnestly02as02if02it02had02been02his02father,02he02besought02
the02police02to02carry02the02unconscious02Marmeladov02to02his02
lodging02at02once.0202
"Just02here,02three02houses02away,"02he02said02eagerly,02"the02
house02belongs02to02Kozel,02a02rich02German.02He02was02going02

But02he'll02die02before02you02get02him02to02the02hospital."02He02
managed02to02slip02something02unseen02into02the02policeman's02
hand.02But02the02thing02was02straightforward02and02legitimate,02
and02in02any02case02help02was02closer02here.02They02raised02the02
injured02man;02people02volunteered02to02help.0202
Kozel's02house02was02thirty02yards02away.02Raskolnikov02
walked02behind,02carefully02holding02Marmeladov's02head02and02
showing02the02way.0202
"This02way,02this02way!02We02must02take02him02upstairs02head02
foremost.02Turn02round!02I'll02pay,02I'll02make02it02worth02your02

Katerina02Ivanovna02had02just02begun,02as02she02always02did02at02
every02free02moment,02walking02to02and02fro02in02her02little02room02
from02window02to02stove02and02back02again,02with02her02arms02
folded02across02her02chest,02talking02to02herself02and02coughing.02Of02

girl,02Polenka,02a02child02of02ten,02who,02though02there02was02much02

big02clever02eyes02and02strove02her02utmost02to02appear02to02

brother,02who02had02been02unwell02all02day02and02was02going02to02
bed.02The02boy02was02waiting02for02her02to02take02off02his02shirt,02
which02had02to02be02washed02at02night.02He02was02sitting02straight02
and02motionless02on02a02chair,02with02a02silent,02serious02face,02with02
his02legs02stretched02out02straight02before02him―heels02together02
and02toes02turned02out.0202
He02was02listening02to02what02his02mother02was02saying02to02his02

open02eyes,02just02as02all02good02little02boys02have02to02sit02when02they02

dressed02literally02in02rags,02stood02at02the02screen,02waiting02for02
her02turn.02The02door02on02to02the02stairs02was02open02to02relieve02
them02a02little02from02the02clouds02of02tobacco02smoke02which02
floated02in02from02the02other02rooms02and02brought02on02long02

Katerina02Ivanovna02seemed02to02have02grown02even02thinner02
during02that02week02and02the02hectic02flush02on02her02face02was02
brighter02than02ever.0202
"You02wouldn't02believe,02you02can't02imagine,02Polenka,"02she02
said,02walking02about02the02room,02"what02a02happy02luxurious02life02

who02were02pushing02into02her02room,02carrying02a02burden.02
"What02is02it?02What02are02they02bringing?02Mercy02on02us!"0202
"Where02are02we02to02put02him?"02asked02the02policeman,02
looking02 round02 when02 Marmeladov,02 unconscious02 and02
covered02with02blood,02had02been02carried02in.0202
"On02the02sofa!02Put02him02straight02on02the02sofa,02with02his02head02

"Run02over02in02the02road!02Drunk!"02someone02shouted02in02the02
passage.0202
Katerina02Ivanovna02stood,02turning02white02and02gasping02for02
breath.02The02children02were02terrified.02Little02Lida02screamed,02
rushed02to02Polenka02and02clutched02at02her,02trembling02all02over.0202
Having02laid02Marmeladov02down,02Raskolnikov02flew02to02
Katerina02Ivanovna.0202
"For02God's02sake02be02calm,02don't02be02frightened!"02he02said,02
speaking02quickly,02"he02was02crossing02the02road02and02was02run02

"He's02done02it02this02time!"02Katerina02Ivanovna02cried02
despairingly02and02she02rushed02to02her02husband.0202
Raskolnikov02noticed02at02once02that02she02was02not02one02of02
those02women02who02swoon02easily.02She02instantly02placed02
under02the02luckless02man's02head02a02pillow,02which02no02one02had02
thought02of02and02began02undressing02and02examining02him.02She02
kept02her02head,02forgetting02herself,02biting02her02trembling02lips02
and02stifling02the02screams02which02were02ready02to02break02from02
her.0202Raskolnikov02meanwhile02induced02someone02to02run02for02a02
doctor.02There02was02a02doctor,02it02appeared,02next02door02but02one.0202
"I've02sent02for02a02doctor,"02he02kept02assuring02Katerina02

Katerina02Ivanovna02ran02to02the02window;02there,02on02a02
broken02chair02in02the02corner,02a02large02earthenware02basin02full02
of02water02had02been02stood,02in02readiness02for02washing02her02
children's02and02husband's02linen02that02night.02This02washing02
was02done02by02Katerina02Ivanovna02at02night02at02least02twice02a02
week,02if02not02oftener.02For02the02family02had02come02to02such02a02
pass02that02they02were02practically02without02change02of02linen,02
and02Katerina02Ivanovna02could02not02endure02uncleanliness02
and,02rather02than02see02dirt02in02the02house,02she02preferred02to02
wear02herself02out02at02night,02working02beyond02her02strength02
when02the02rest02were02asleep,02so02as02to02get02the02wet02linen02hung02
on02a02line02and02dry02by02the02morning.02She02took02up02the02basin02of02
water02at02Raskolnikov's02request,02but02almost02fell02down02with02
her02burden.02But02the02latter02had02already02succeeded02in02
finding02a02towel,02wetted02it02and02began02washing02the02blood02off02
Marmeladov's02face.0202
Katerina02Ivanovna02stood02by,02breathing02painfully02and02
pressing02her02hands02to02her02breast.02She02was02in02need02of02
attention02herself.02Raskolnikov02began02to02realise02that02he02
might02have02made02a02mistake02in02having02the02injured02man02
brought02here.02The02policeman,02too,02stood02in02hesitation.0202
"Polenka,"02cried02Katerina02Ivanovna,02"run02to02Sonia,02make02
haste.02If02you02don't02find02her02at02home,02leave02word02that02her02

"Run02your02fastest!"02cried02the02little02boy02on02the02chair02
suddenly,02after02which02he02relapsed02into02the02same02dumb02
rigidity,02with02round02eyes,02his02heels02thrust02forward02and02his02
toes02spread02out.0202
Meanwhile02the02room02had02become02so02full02of02people02that02
you02couldn't02have02dropped02a02pin.02The02policemen02left,02all02
except02one,02who02remained02for02a02time,02trying02to02drive02out02
the02people02who02came02in02from02the02stairs.02Almost02all02
Madame02Lippevechsel's02lodgers02had02streamed02in02from02the02
inner02rooms02of02the02flat;02at02first02they02were02squeezed02
together02in02the02doorway,02but02afterwards02they02overflowed02
into02the02room.02Katerina02Ivanovna02flew02into02a02fury.0202
"You02might02let02him02die02in02peace,02at02least,"02she02shouted02at02
the02crowd,02"is02it02a02spectacle02for02you02to02gape02at?02With02
cigarettes!02(Cough,02cough,02cough!)02You02might02as02well02keep02
your02hats02on....02And02there02is02one02in02his02hat!...02Get02away!02You02
should02respect02the02dead,02at02least!"0202
Her02cough02choked02her―but02her02reproaches02were02not02
without02result.02They02evidently02stood02in02some02awe02of02
Katerina02 Ivanovna.02 The02
lodgers,02 one02 after02 another,02
squeezed02back02into02the02doorway02with02that02strange02inner02
feeling02of02satisfaction02which02may02be02observed02in02the02
presence02of02a02sudden02accident,02even02in02those02nearest02and02
dearest02to02the02victim,02from02which02no02living02man02is02exempt,02
even02in02spite02of02the02sincerest02sympathy02and02compassion.0202
Voices02outside02were02heard,02however,02speaking02of02the02
hospital02and02saying02that02they'd02no02business02to02make02a02
disturbance02here.0202
"No02business02to02die!"02cried02Katerina02Ivanovna,02and02she02
was02rushing02to02the02door02to02vent02her02wrath02upon02them,02but02
in02 the02 doorway02 came02
face02 with02 Madame02
face02 to02
Lippevechsel02who02had02only02just02heard02of02the02accident02and02
ran02in02to02restore02order.02She02was02a02particularly02quarrelsome02
and02irresponsible02German.0202
"Ah,02my02God!"02she02cried,02clasping02her02hands,02"your02
husband02drunken02horses02have02trampled!02To02the02hospital02
with02him!02I02am02the02landlady!"0202
"Amalia02Ludwigovna,02I02beg02you02to02recollect02what02you02
are02saying,"02Katerina02Ivanovna02began02haughtily02(she02
always02took02a02haughty02tone02with02the02landlady02that02she02
might02"remember02her02place"02and02even02now02could02not02deny02
herself02this02satisfaction).02"Amalia02Ludwigovna..."0202
"I02have02you02once02before02told02that02you02to02call02me02Amalia02

"You02are02not02Amalia02Ivanovna,02but02Amalia02Ludwigovna,02
and02as02I02am02not02one02of02your02despicable02flatterers02like02Mr.02
Lebeziatnikov,02who's02laughing02behind02the02door02at02this02

has02often02been02a02benefactor02to02him.02Everyone02knows02that02

whom02he02abandoned02himself02from02an02honourable02pride,02

assured,02Amalia02Ludwigovna..."0202
All02this02was02uttered02with02extreme02rapidity,02getting02
quicker02and02quicker,02but02a02cough02suddenly02cut02short02
Katerina02Ivanovna's02eloquence.02At02that02instant02the02dying02
man02recovered02consciousness02and02uttered02a02groan;02she02ran02
to02him.02The02injured02man02opened02his02eyes02and02without02
recognition02or02understanding02gazed02at02Raskolnikov02who02
was02bending02over02him.02He02drew02deep,02slow,02painful02
breaths;02blood02oozed02at02the02corners02of02his02mouth02and02
drops02of02perspiration02came02out02on02his02forehead.02Not02
recognising02Raskolnikov,02he02began02looking02round02uneasily.02
Katerina02Ivanovna02looked02at02him02with02a02sad02but02stern02face,02
and02tears02trickled02from02her02eyes.0202
"My02God!02His02whole02chest02is02crushed!02How02he02is02
bleeding,"02she02said02in02despair.02"We02must02take02off02his02
clothes.02Turn02a02little,02Semyon02Zaharovitch,02if02you02can,"02she02
cried02to02him.0202
Marmeladov02recognised02her.0202
"A02priest,"02he02articulated02huskily.0202
Katerina02Ivanovna02walked02to02the02window,02laid02her02head02
against02the02window02frame02and02exclaimed02in02despair:0202
"Oh,02cursed02life!"0202
"A02priest,"02the02dying02man02said02again02after02a02moment's02
silence.0202
"They've02gone02for02him,"02Katerina02Ivanovna02shouted02to02
him,02he02obeyed02her02shout02and02was02silent.02With02sad02and02
timid02eyes02he02looked02for02her;02she02returned02and02stood02by02
his02pillow.02He02seemed02a02little02easier02but02not02for02long.0202
Soon02his02eyes02rested02on02little02Lida,02his02favourite,02who02
was02shaking02in02the02corner,02as02though02she02were02in02a02fit,02and02
staring02at02him02with02her02wondering02childish02eyes.0202
"A\ah,"02he02signed02towards02her02uneasily.02He02wanted02to02
say02something.0202
"What02now?"02cried02Katerina02Ivanovna.0202
"Barefoot,02barefoot!"02he02muttered,02indicating02with02
frenzied02eyes02the02child's02bare02feet.0202
"Be02silent,"02Katerina02Ivanovna02cried02irritably,02"you02
know02why02she02is02barefooted."0202
"Thank02 God,02 the02 doctor,"02 exclaimed02 Raskolnikov,02
relieved.0202
The02doctor02came02in,02a02precise02little02old02man,02a02German,02
looking02about02him02mistrustfully;02he02went02up02to02the02sick02
man,02took02his02pulse,02carefully02felt02his02head02and02with02the02
help02of02Katerina02Ivanovna02he02unbuttoned02the02blood\
stained02shirt,02and02bared02the02injured02man's02chest.02It02was02
gashed,02crushed02and02fractured,02several02ribs02on02the02right02
side02were02broken.02On02the02left02side,02just02over02the02heart,02was02
a02large,02sinister\looking02yellowish\black02bruise―a02cruel02
kick02from02the02horse's02hoof.02The02doctor02frowned.02The02
policeman02told02him02that02he02was02caught02in02the02wheel02and02
turned02round02with02it02for02thirty02yards02on02the02road.0202
"It's02wonderful02that02he02has02recovered02consciousness,"02
the02doctor02whispered02softly02to02Raskolnikov.0202
"What02do02you02think02of02him?"02he02asked.0202
"He02will02die02immediately."0202
"Is02there02really02no02hope?"0202
"Not02the02faintest!02He02is02at02the02last02gasp....02His02head02is02
badly02injured,02too...02Hm...02I02could02bleed02him02if02you02like,02but...02
it02would02be02useless.02He02is02bound02to02die02within02the02next02five02
or02ten02minutes."0202
"Better02bleed02him02then."0202
"If02you02like....02But02I02warn02you02it02will02be02perfectly02
useless."0202
At02that02moment02other02steps02were02heard;02the02crowd02in02
the02passage02parted,02and02the02priest,02a02little,02grey02old02man,02
appeared02in02the02doorway02bearing02the02sacrament.02A02
policeman02had02gone02for02him02at02the02time02of02the02accident.02
The02doctor02changed02places02with02him,02exchanging02glances02
with02him.02Raskolnikov02begged02the02doctor02to02remain02a02little02
while.02He02shrugged02his02shoulders02and02remained.0202
All02stepped02back.02The02confession02was02soon02over.02The02
dying02man02probably02understood02little;02he02could02only02utter02
indistinct02broken02sounds.02Katerina02Ivanovna02took02little02
Lida,02lifted02the02boy02from02the02chair,02knelt02down02in02the02
corner02by02the02stove02and02made02the02children02kneel02in02front02of02
her.02The02little02girl02was02still02trembling;02but02the02boy,02kneeling02
on02his02little02bare02knees,02lifted02his02hand02rhythmically,02
crossing02himself02with02precision02and02bowed02down,02touching02
the02floor02with02his02forehead,02which02seemed02to02afford02him02
especial02satisfaction.02Katerina02Ivanovna02bit02her02lips02and02
held02back02her02tears;02she02prayed,02too,02now02and02then02pulling02
straight02the02boy's02shirt,02and02managed02to02cover02the02girl's02
bare02shoulders02with02a02kerchief,02which02she02took02from02the02
chest02without02rising02from02her02knees02or02ceasing02to02pray.02
Meanwhile02the02door02from02the02inner02rooms02was02opened02
inquisitively02again.02In02the02passage02the02crowd02of02spectators02
from02all02the02flats02on02the02staircase02grew02denser02and02denser,02
but02they02did02not02venture02beyond02the02threshold.02A02single02
candle\end02lighted02up02the02scene.0202
At02that02moment02Polenka02forced02her02way02through02the02
crowd02at02the02door.02She02came02in02panting02from02running02so02
fast,02took02off02her02kerchief,02looked02for02her02mother,02went02up02
to02her02and02said,02"She's02coming,02I02met02her02in02the02street."02Her02
mother02made02her02kneel02beside02her.0202
Timidly02and02noiselessly02a02young02girl02made02her02way02
through02the02crowd,02and02strange02was02her02appearance02in02
that02room,02in02the02midst02of02want,02rags,02death02and02despair.02
She,02too,02was02in02rags,02her02attire02was02all02of02the02cheapest,02but02
in02 gutter02
decked02 out02
finery02 of02 a02 special02 stamp,02
unmistakably02 betraying02
its02 shameful02 purpose.02 Sonia02
stopped02short02in02the02doorway02and02looked02about02her02
bewildered,02unconscious02of02everything.02She02forgot02her02
fourth\hand,02gaudy02silk02dress,02so02unseemly02here02with02its02
ridiculous02long02train,02and02her02immense02crinoline02that02filled02
up02the02whole02doorway,02and02her02light\coloured02shoes,02and02
the02parasol02she02brought02with02her,02though02it02was02no02use02at02
night,02and02the02absurd02round02straw02hat02with02its02flaring02
flame\coloured02feather.02Under02this02rakishly\tilted02hat02was02
a02pale,02frightened02little02face02with02lips02parted02and02eyes02
staring02in02terror.02Sonia02was02a02small02thin02girl02of02eighteen02
with02fair02hair,02rather02pretty,02with02wonderful02blue02eyes.02She02
looked02intently02at02the02bed02and02the02priest;02she02too02was02out02
of02breath02with02running.02At02last02whispers,02some02words02in02
the02crowd02probably,02reached02her.02She02looked02down02and02
took02a02step02forward02into02the02room,02still02keeping02close02to02
the02door.0202
The02service02was02over.02Katerina02Ivanovna02went02up02to02her02
husband02again.02The02priest02stepped02back02and02turned02to02say02
a02few02words02of02admonition02and02consolation02to02Katerina02
Ivanovna02on02leaving.0202
"What02am02I02to02do02with02these?"02she02interrupted02sharply02
and02irritably,02pointing02to02the02little02ones.0202
"God02is02merciful;02look02to02the02Most02High02for02succour,"02the02
priest02began.0202
"Ach!02He02is02merciful,02but02not02to02us."0202
"That's02a02sin,02a02sin,02madam,"02observed02the02priest,02
shaking02his02head.0202
"And02isn't02that02a02sin?"02cried02Katerina02Ivanovna,02pointing02
to02the02dying02man.0202
"Perhaps02those02who02have02involuntarily02caused02the02
accident02will02agree02to02compensate02you,02at02least02for02the02loss02
of02his02earnings."0202
"You02 don't02 understand!"02 cried02 Katerina02 Ivanovna02
they02
angrily02 waving02 her02 hand.02 "And02 why02 should02
compensate02me?02Why,02he02was02drunk02and02threw02himself02
under02the02horses!02What02earnings?02He02brought02us02in02
nothing02but02misery.02He02drank02everything02away,02the02
drunkard!02He02robbed02us02to02get02drink,02he02wasted02their02lives02
and02mine02for02drink!02And02thank02God02he's02dying!02One02less02to02
keep!"0202
"You02must02forgive02in02the02hour02of02death,02that's02a02sin,02
madam,02such02feelings02are02a02great02sin."0202
Katerina02Ivanovna02was02busy02with02the02dying02man;02she02
was02giving02him02water,02wiping02the02blood02and02sweat02from02
his02head,02setting02his02pillow02straight,02and02had02only02turned02
now02and02then02for02a02moment02to02address02the02priest.02Now02she02
flew02at02him02almost02in02a02frenzy.0202
"Ah,02father!02That's02words02and02only02words!02Forgive!02If02
he'd02not02been02run02over,02he'd02have02come02home02to\day02
drunk02and02his02only02shirt02dirty02and02in02rags02and02he'd02have02
fallen02asleep02like02a02log,02and02I02should02have02been02sousing02and02
rinsing02till02daybreak,02washing02his02rags02and02the02children's02
and02then02drying02them02by02the02window02and02as02soon02as02it02was02
daylight02I02should02have02been02darning02them.02That's02how02I02
spend02 my02 nights!...02 What's02
the02 use02 of02 talking02 of02
forgiveness!02I02have02forgiven02as02it02is!"0202
A02terrible02hollow02cough02interrupted02her02words.02She02put02
her02handkerchief02to02her02lips02and02showed02it02to02the02priest,02
pressing02 her02 other02 hand02 to02 her02 aching02 chest.02 The02
handkerchief02was02covered02with02blood.02The02priest02bowed02
his02head02and02said02nothing.0202
Marmeladov02was02in02the02last02agony;02he02did02not02take02his02
eyes02off02the02face02of02Katerina02Ivanovna,02who02was02bending02
over02him02again.02He02kept02trying02to02say02something02to02her;02he02
began02moving02his02tongue02with02difficulty02and02articulating02
indistinctly,02but02Katerina02Ivanovna,02understanding02that02he02
wanted02to02ask02her02forgiveness,02called02peremptorily02to02him:0202
"Be02silent!02No02need!02I02know02what02you02want02to02say!"02And02
the02sick02man02was02silent,02but02at02the02same02instant02his02
wandering02eyes02strayed02to02the02doorway02and02he02saw02Sonia.0202
Till02then02he02had02not02noticed02her:02she02was02standing02in02
the02shadow02in02a02corner.0202
"Who's02that?02Who's02that?"02he02said02suddenly02in02a02thick02
gasping02voice,02in02agitation,02turning02his02eyes02in02horror02
towards02the02door02where02his02daughter02was02standing,02and02
trying02to02sit02up.0202
"Lie02down!02Lie02do\own!"02cried02Katerina02Ivanovna.0202
With02unnatural02strength02he02had02succeeded02in02propping02
himself02on02his02elbow.02He02looked02wildly02and02fixedly02for02
some02time02on02his02daughter,02as02though02not02recognising02her.02
He02had02never02seen02her02before02in02such02attire.02Suddenly02he02
recognised02her,02crushed02and02ashamed02in02her02humiliation02
and02gaudy02finery,02meekly02awaiting02her02turn02to02say02good\
bye02to02her02dying02father.02His02face02showed02intense02suffering.0202
"Sonia!02Daughter!02Forgive!"02he02cried,02and02he02tried02to02
hold02out02his02hand02to02her,02but02losing02his02balance,02he02fell02off02
the02sofa,02face02downwards02on02the02floor.02They02rushed02to02pick02
him02up,02they02put02him02on02the02sofa;02but02he02was02dying.02Sonia02
with02a02faint02cry02ran02up,02embraced02him02and02remained02so02
without02moving.02He02died02in02her02arms.0202
"He's02got02what02he02wanted,"02Katerina02Ivanovna02cried,02
seeing02her02husband's02dead02body.02"Well,02what's02to02be02done02
now?02How02am02I02to02bury02him!02What02can02I02give02them02to\
morrow02to02eat?"0202
Raskolnikov02went02up02to02Katerina02Ivanovna.0202
"Katerina02 Ivanovna,"02 he02 began,02 "last02 week02 your02
husband02told02me02all02his02life02and02circumstances....02Believe02
me,02he02spoke02of02you02with02passionate02reverence.02From02that02
evening,02when02I02learnt02how02devoted02he02was02to02you02all02and02
how02he02loved02and02respected02you02especially,02Katerina02
Ivanovna,02in02spite02of02his02unfortunate02weakness,02from02that02
evening02we02became02friends....02Allow02me02now...02to02do02
something...02to02repay02my02debt02to02my02dead02friend.02Here02are02
twenty02roubles,02I02think―and02if02that02can02be02of02any02

will02be02sure02to02come02again...02I02shall,02perhaps,02come02again02to\
morrow....02Good\bye!"0202
And02he02went02quickly02out02of02the02room,02squeezing02his02way02
through02the02crowd02to02the02stairs.02But02in02the02crowd02he02
suddenly02jostled02against02Nikodim02Fomitch,02who02had02heard02
of02the02accident02and02had02come02to02give02instructions02in02
person.02They02had02not02met02since02the02scene02at02the02police02
station,02but02Nikodim02Fomitch02knew02him02instantly.0202
"Ah,02is02that02you?"02he02asked02him.0202
"He's02dead,"02answered02Raskolnikov.02"The02doctor02and02
the02priest02have02been,02all02as02it02should02have02been.02Don't02
worry02the02poor02woman02too02much,02she02is02in02consumption02as02
it02is.02Try02and02cheer02her02up,02if02possible...02you02are02a02kind\
hearted02man,02I02know..."02he02added02with02a02smile,02looking02
straight02in02his02face.0202
it,02 entirely02 absorbed02
"But02you02are02spattered02with02blood,"02observed02Nikodim02
Fomitch,02noticing02in02the02lamplight02some02fresh02stains02on02
Raskolnikov's02waistcoat.0202
"Yes...02I'm02covered02with02blood,"02Raskolnikov02said02with02a02
peculiar02air;02then02he02smiled,02nodded02and02went02downstairs.0202
He02walked02down02slowly02and02deliberately,02feverish02but02
not02 conscious02 of02
in02 a02 new02
overwhelming02sensation02of02life02and02strength02that02surged02
up02 suddenly02 within02 him.02 This02 sensation02 might02 be02
compared02to02that02of02a02man02condemned02to02death02who02has02
suddenly02been02pardoned.02Halfway02down02the02staircase02he02
was02overtaken02by02the02priest02on02his02way02home;02Raskolnikov02
let02him02pass,02exchanging02a02silent02greeting02with02him.02He02was02
just02descending02the02last02steps02when02he02heard02rapid02
footsteps02behind02him.02Someone02overtook02him;02it02was02
Polenka.02She02was02running02after02him,02calling02"Wait!02wait!"0202
He02turned02round.02She02was02at02the02bottom02of02the02staircase02
and02stopped02short02a02step02above02him.02A02dim02light02came02in02
from02the02yard.02Raskolnikov02could02distinguish02the02child's02
thin02but02pretty02little02face,02looking02at02him02with02a02bright02
childish02smile.02She02had02run02after02him02with02a02message02
which02she02was02evidently02glad02to02give.0202
"Tell02me,02what02is02your02name?...02and02where02do02you02live?"02
she02said02hurriedly02in02a02breathless02voice.0202
He02laid02both02hands02on02her02shoulders02and02looked02at02her02
with02a02sort02of02rapture.02It02was02such02a02joy02to02him02to02look02at02
her,02he02could02not02have02said02why.0202
"Who02sent02you?"0202
"Sister02Sonia02sent02me,"02answered02the02girl,02smiling02still02
more02brightly.0202
"I02knew02it02was02sister02Sonia02sent02you."0202
"Mamma02sent02me,02too...02when02sister02Sonia02was02sending02
me,02mamma02came02up,02too,02and02said02'Run02fast,02Polenka.'"0202
"Do02you02love02sister02Sonia?"0202
"I02love02her02more02than02anyone,"02Polenka02answered02with02
a02peculiar02earnestness,02and02her02smile02became02graver.0202
"And02will02you02love02me?"0202
By02way02of02answer02he02saw02the02
little02girl's02face02
approaching02him,02her02full02lips02na07vely02held02out02to02kiss02him.02
Suddenly02her02arms02as02thin02as02sticks02held02him02tightly,02her02
head02rested02on02his02shoulder02and02the02little02girl02wept02softly,02
pressing02her02face02against02him.0202
"I02am02sorry02for02father,"02she02said02a02moment02later,02raising02
her02tear\stained02face02and02brushing02away02the02tears02with02her02
hands.02"It's02nothing02but02misfortunes02now,"02she02added02
suddenly02with02that02peculiarly02sedate02air02which02children02try02
hard02to02assume02when02they02want02to02speak02like02grown\up02
people.0202
"Did02your02father02love02you?"0202
"He02loved02Lida02most,"02she02went02on02very02seriously02
without02a02smile,02exactly02like02grown\up02people,02"he02loved02
her02because02she02is02little02and02because02she02is02ill,02too.02And02he02
always02used02to02bring02her02presents.02But02he02taught02us02to02read02

dignity.02"And02mother02never02used02to02say02anything,02but02we02
knew02that02she02liked02it02and02father02knew02it,02too.02And02mother02
wants02to02teach02me02French,02for02it's02time02my02education02

"And02do02you02know02your02prayers?"0202
"Of02course,02we02do!02We02knew02them02long02ago.02I02say02my02

this02is02another02one,02but02we02do02pray02for02the02other02as02well."0202
"Polenka,02my02name02is02Rodion.02Pray02sometimes02for02me,02
too.02'And02Thy02servant02Rodion,'02nothing02more."0202
"I'll02pray02for02you02all02the02rest02of02my02life,"02the02little02girl02
declared02hotly,02and02suddenly02smiling02again02she02rushed02at02
him02and02hugged02him02warmly02once02more.0202
Raskolnikov02told02her02his02name02and02address02and02
promised02to02be02sure02to02come02next02day.02The02child02went02
away02quite02enchanted02with02him.02It02was02past02ten02when02he02
came02out02into02the02street.02In02five02minutes02he02was02standing02
on02the02bridge02at02the02spot02where02the02woman02had02jumped02in.0202
"Enough,"02he02pronounced02resolutely02and02triumphantly.02
"I've02done02with02fancies,02imaginary02terrors02and02phantoms!02
Life02is02real!02haven't02I02lived02just02now?02My02life02has02not02yet02

he02added02defiantly,02as02though02challenging02some02power02of02
darkness.02"And02I02was02ready02to02consent02to02live02in02a02square02of02

and02self\confidently02and02he02walked02with02flagging02footsteps02
from02
the02 bridge.02 Pride02 and02 self\confidence02 grew02
continually02stronger02in02him;02he02was02becoming02a02different02
man02every02moment.02What02was02it02had02happened02to02work02
this02revolution02in02him?02He02did02not02know02himself;02like02a02
company02
consisted02 of02
man02catching02at02a02straw,02he02suddenly02felt02that02he,02too,02
'could02live,02that02there02was02still02life02for02him,02that02his02life02had02
not02died02with02the02old02woman.'02Perhaps02he02was02in02too02great02
a02hurry02with02his02conclusions,02but02he02did02not02think02of02that.0202
"But02I02did02ask02her02to02remember02'Thy02servant02Rodion'02in02

of02emergency,"02he02added02and02laughed02himself02at02his02boyish02
sally.02He02was02in02the02best02of02spirits.0202
He02easily02found02Razumihin;02the02new02lodger02was02already02
known02at02Potchinkov's02and02the02porter02at02once02showed02him02
the02way.02Half\way02upstairs02he02could02hear02the02noise02and02
animated02conversation02of02a02big02gathering02of02people.02The02
door02was02wide02open02on02the02stairs;02he02could02hear02
exclamations02and02discussion.02Razumihin's02room02was02fairly02
the02
large;02
fifteen02 people.02
Raskolnikov02stopped02in02the02entry,02where02two02of02the02
landlady's02servants02were02busy02behind02a02screen02with02two02
samovars,02bottles,02plates02and02dishes02of02pie02and02savouries,02
brought02up02from02the02landlady's02kitchen.02Raskolnikov02sent02
in02for02Razumihin.02He02ran02out02delighted.02At02the02first02glance02
it02was02apparent02that02he02had02had02a02great02deal02to02drink02and,02
though02no02amount02of02liquor02made02Razumihin02quite02drunk,02
this02time02he02was02perceptibly02affected02by02it.0202
"Listen,"02Raskolnikov02hastened02to02say,02"I've02only02just02

"He?02Goodness02only02knows!02Some02friend02of02uncle's,02I02

Zossimov02pounced02upon02Raskolnikov02almost02greedily;02
he02showed02a02special02interest02in02him;02soon02his02face02
brightened.0202
"You02must02go02to02bed02at02once,"02he02pronounced,02
examining02the02patient02as02far02as02he02could,02"and02take02
something02for02the02night.02Will02you02take02it?02I02got02it02ready02

"Two,02if02you02like,"02answered02Raskolnikov.02The02powder02
was02taken02at02once.0202
"It's02a02good02thing02you02are02taking02him02home,"02observed02

"Do02you02know02what02Zossimov02whispered02to02me02when02

your02acquaintance..."0202
"Ah!...02he02too...02but02why02did02they02put02me02down02as02mad?"0202
"Oh,02not02mad.02I02must02have02said02too02much,02brother....02
What02struck02him,02you02see,02was02that02only02that02subject02
seemed02to02interest02you;02now02it's02clear02why02it02did02interest02
you;02knowing02all02the02circumstances...02and02how02that02
irritated02you02and02worked02in02with02your02illness...02I02am02a02little02
drunk,02brother,02only,02confound02him,02he02has02some02idea02of02
his02own...02I02tell02you,02he's02mad02on02mental02diseases.02But02don't02
you02mind02him..."0202
For02half02a02minute02both02were02silent.0202
"Listen,02Razumihin,"02began02Raskolnikov,02"I02want02to02tell02
you02plainly:02I've02just02been02at02a02death\bed,02a02clerk02who02
died...02I02gave02them02all02my02money...02and02besides02I've02just02
been02kissed02by02someone02who,02if02I02had02killed02anyone,02would02
just02the02same...02in02fact02I02saw02someone02else02there...02with02a02
flame\coloured02feather...02but02I02am02talking02nonsense;02I02am02
very02weak,02support02me...02we02shall02be02at02the02stairs02
directly..."0202
"What's02the02matter?02What's02the02matter02with02you?"02
Razumihin02asked02anxiously.0202
"I02am02a02little02giddy,02but02that's02not02the02point,02I02am02so02sad,02
so02sad...02like02a02woman.02Look,02what's02that?02Look,02look!"0202
"What02is02it?"0202
"Don't02you02see?02A02light02in02my02room,02you02see?02Through02
the02crack..."0202
They02were02already02at02the02foot02of02the02last02flight02of02stairs,02
at02the02level02of02the02landlady's02door,02and02they02could,02as02a02fact,02
see02from02below02that02there02was02a02light02in02Raskolnikov's02
garret.0202
"Queer!02Nastasya,02perhaps,"02observed02Razumihin.0202
"She02is02never02in02my02room02at02this02time02and02she02must02be02
in02bed02long02ago,02but...02I02don't02care!02Good\bye!"0202
"What02do02you02mean?02I02am02coming02with02you,02we'll02come02
in02together!"0202
"I02know02we02are02going02in02together,02but02I02want02to02shake02
hands02here02and02say02good\bye02to02you02here.02So02give02me02your02
hand,02good\bye!"0202
"What's02the02matter02with02you,02Rodya?"0202
"Nothing...02come02along...02you02shall02be02witness."0202
They02began02mounting02the02stairs,02and02the02idea02struck02
Razumihin02that02perhaps02Zossimov02might02be02right02after02all.02
"Ah,02I've02upset02him02with02my02chatter!"02he02muttered02to02
himself.0202When02they02reached02the02door02they02heard02voices02in02the02
room.0202
"What02is02it?"02cried02Razumihin.02Raskolnikov02was02the02first02
to02open02the02door;02he02flung02it02wide02and02stood02still02in02the02
doorway,02dumbfoundered.0202
His02mother02and02sister02were02sitting02on02his02sofa02and02had02
been02waiting02an02hour02and02a02half02for02him.02Why02had02he02never02
expected,02never02thought02of02them,02though02the02news02that02
they02had02started,02were02on02their02way02and02would02arrive02
immediately,02had02been02repeated02to02him02only02that02day?02
They02had02spent02that02hour02and02a02half02plying02Nastasya02with02
questions.02She02was02standing02before02them02and02had02told02
them02everything02by02now.02They02were02beside02themselves02
with02alarm02when02they02heard02of02his02"running02away"02to\day,02
ill02and,02as02they02understood02from02her02story,02delirious!02"Good02
Heavens,02what02had02become02of02him?"02Both02had02been02
weeping,02both02had02been02in02anguish02for02that02hour02and02a02half.0202
A02cry02of02joy,02of02ecstasy,02greeted02Raskolnikov's02entrance.02
Both02rushed02to02him.02But02he02stood02like02one02dead;02a02sudden02
intolerable02sensation02struck02him02like02a02thunderbolt.02He02did02
not02lift02his02arms02to02embrace02them,02he02could02not.02His02mother02
and02sister02clasped02him02in02their02arms,02kissed02him,02laughed02
and02cried.02He02took02a02step,02tottered02and02fell02to02the02ground,02
fainting.0202
Anxiety,02cries02of02horror,02moans...02Razumihin02who02was02
standing02in02the02doorway02flew02into02the02room,02seized02the02
sick02man02in02his02strong02arms02and02in02a02moment02had02him02on02
the02sofa.0202
"It's02nothing,02nothing!"02he02cried02to02the02mother02and02
sister―"it's02only02a02faint,02a02mere02trifle!02Only02just02now02the02
doctor02said02he02was02much02better,02that02he02is02perfectly02well!02
Water!02See,02he02is02coming02to02himself,02he02is02all02right02again!"0202
And02seizing02Dounia02by02the02arm02so02that02he02almost02
dislocated02it,02he02made02her02bend02down02to02see02that02"he02is02all02
right02again."02The02mother02and02sister02looked02on02him02with02
emotion02and02gratitude,02as02their02Providence.02They02had02
heard02already02from02Nastasya02all02that02had02been02done02for02
their02Rodya02during02his02illness,02by02this02"very02competent02

0202
Raskolnikov02got02up,02and02sat02down02on02the02sofa.02He02
waved02his02hand02weakly02to02Razumihin02to02cut02short02the02flow02
of02warm02and02incoherent02consolations02he02was02addressing02to02
his02mother02and02sister,02took02them02both02by02the02hand02and02for02
a02minute02or02two02gazed02from02one02to02the02other02without02
speaking.02His02mother02was02alarmed02by02his02expression.02It02
revealed02an02emotion02agonisingly02poignant,02and02at02the02same02
time02something02immovable,02almost02insane.02Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna02began02to02cry.0202
Avdotya02Romanovna02was02pale;02her02hand02trembled02in02
her02brother's.0202
"Go02home...02with02him,"02he02said02in02a02broken02voice,02
pointing02to02Razumihin,02"good\bye02till02to\morrow;02to\
morrow02everything...02Is02it02long02since02you02arrived?"0202
Pulcheria02
answered02
Rodya,"02
evening,02
"This02
Alexandrovna,02"the02train02was02awfully02late.02But,02Rodya,02
nothing02would02induce02me02to02leave02you02now!02I02will02spend02
the02night02here,02near02you..."0202
"Don't02torture02me!"02he02said02with02a02gesture02of02irritation.0202
"I02will02stay02with02him,"02cried02Razumihin,02"I02won't02leave02
him02for02a02moment.02Bother02all02my02visitors!02Let02them02rage02to02
their02hearts'02content!02My02uncle02is02presiding02there."0202
"How,02how02can02I02thank02you!"02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02
was02beginning,02once02more02pressing02Razumihin's02hands,02
but02Raskolnikov02interrupted02her02again.0202
"I02can't02have02it!02I02can't02have02it!"02he02repeated02irritably,02
"don't02worry02me!02Enough,02go02away...02I02can't02stand02it!"0202
"Come,02mamma,02come02out02of02the02room02at02least02for02a02
minute,"02Dounia02whispered02in02dismay;02"we02are02distressing02
him,02that's02evident."0202
"Mayn't02I02look02at02him02after02three02years?"02wept02Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna.0202
"Stay,"02he02stopped02them02again,02"you02keep02interrupting02
me,02and02my02ideas02get02muddled....02Have02you02seen02Luzhin?"0202
"No,02Rodya,02but02he02knows02already02of02our02arrival.02We02
have02heard,02Rodya,02that02Pyotr02Petrovitch02was02so02kind02as02to02
visit02you02today,"02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02added02somewhat02
timidly.0202
"Yes...02he02was02so02kind...02Dounia,02I02promised02Luzhin02I'd02
throw02him02downstairs02and02told02him02to02go02to02hell...."0202
"Rodya,02what02are02you02saying!02Surely,02you02don't02mean02to02
tell02us..."02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02began02in02alarm,02but02she02
stopped,02looking02at02Dounia.0202
Avdotya02Romanovna02was02looking02attentively02at02her02
brother,02waiting02for02what02would02come02next.02Both02of02them02
had02heard02of02the02quarrel02from02Nastasya,02so02far02as02she02had02
succeeded02in02understanding02and02reporting02it,02and02were02in02
painful02perplexity02and02suspense.0202
"Dounia,"02Raskolnikov02continued02with02an02effort,02"I02don't02
want02that02marriage,02so02at02the02first02opportunity02to\morrow02
you02must02refuse02Luzhin,02so02that02we02may02never02hear02his02
name02again."0202
"Good02Heavens!"02cried02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna.0202
"Brother,02
think02 what02 you02 are02 saying!"02 Avdotya02
Romanovna02began02impetuously,02but02immediately02checked02
herself.02"You02are02not02fit02to02talk02now,02perhaps;02you02are02
tired,"02she02added02gently.0202
"You02think02I02am02delirious?02No...02You02are02marrying02
Luzhin02for02my02sake.02But02I02won't02accept02the02sacrifice.02And02so02
write02a02letter02before02to\morrow,02to02refuse02him...02Let02me02
read02it02in02the02morning02and02that02will02be02the02end02of02it!"0202
"That02I02can't02do!"02the02girl02cried,02offended,02"what02right02
have02you..."0202
"Dounia,02you02are02hasty,02too,02be02quiet,02to\morrow...02Don't02
you02see..."02the02mother02interposed02in02dismay.02"Better02come02
away!"0202
"He02is02raving,"02Razumihin02cried02tipsily,02"or02how02would02
he02dare!02To\morrow02all02this02nonsense02will02be02over...02to\day02
he02certainly02did02drive02him02away.02That02was02so.02And02Luzhin02
got02angry,02too....02He02made02speeches02here,02wanted02to02show02
off02his02learning02and02he02went02out02crest\fallen...."0202
"Then02it's02true?"02cried02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna.0202
"Good\bye02
to\morrow,02 brother,"02 said02 Dounia02
compassionately―"let02us02go,02mother...02Good\bye,02Rodya."0202
"Do02you02hear,02sister,"02he02repeated02after02them,02making02a02
last02effort,02"I02am02not02delirious;02this02marriage02is―an02infamy.02
Let02me02act02like02a02scoundrel,02but02you02mustn't...02one02is02
enough...02and02though02I02am02a02scoundrel,02I02wouldn't02own02
such02a02sister.02It's02me02or02Luzhin!02Go02now...."0202
"But02 you're02 out02 of02 your02 mind!02 Despot!"02 roared02
Razumihin;02but02Raskolnikov02did02not02and02perhaps02could02not02
answer.02He02lay02down02on02the02sofa,02and02turned02to02the02wall,02
utterly02 exhausted.02 Avdotya02 Romanovna02
looked02 with02
interest02at02Razumihin;02her02black02eyes02flashed;02Razumihin02
positively02started02at02her02glance.0202
Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02stood02overwhelmed.0202
till02
"Nothing02would02induce02me02to02go,"02she02whispered02in02
despair02to02Razumihin.02"I02will02stay02somewhere02here...02escort02
Dounia02home."0202
"You'll02spoil02everything,"02Razumihin02answered02in02the02
same02whisper,02losing02patience―"come02out02on02to02the02stairs,02
anyway.02Nastasya,02show02a02light!02I02assure02you,"02he02went02on02
in02a02half02whisper02on02the02stairs\"that02he02was02almost02beating02
the02doctor02and02me02this02afternoon!02Do02you02understand?02The02
doctor02himself!02Even02he02gave02way02and02left02him,02so02as02not02to02
irritate02him.02I02remained02downstairs02on02guard,02but02he02
dressed02at02once02and02slipped02off.02And02he02will02slip02off02again02if02
you02irritate02him,02at02this02time02of02night,02and02will02do02himself02
some02mischief...."0202
"What02are02you02saying?"0202
"And02Avdotya02Romanovna02can't02possibly02be02left02in02
those02lodgings02without02you.02Just02think02where02you02are02
staying!02That02blackguard02Pyotr02Petrovitch02couldn't02find02
you02better02lodgings...02But02you02know02I've02had02a02little02to02
drink,02and02that's02what02makes02me...02swear;02don't02mind02it...."0202
the02
"But02
to02
landlady02 here,"02 Pulcheria02
I'll02 go02
Alexandrovna02insisted,02"Ill02beseech02her02to02find02some02
corner02for02Dounia02and02me02for02the02night.02I02can't02leave02him02
like02that,02I02cannot!"0202
This02conversation02took02place02on02the02landing02just02before02
the02landlady's02door.02Nastasya02lighted02them02from02a02step02
below.02Razumihin02was02in02extraordinary02excitement.02Half02
an02hour02earlier,02while02he02was02bringing02Raskolnikov02home,02
he02had02indeed02talked02too02freely,02but02he02was02aware02of02it02
himself,02and02his02head02was02clear02in02spite02of02the02vast02
quantities02he02had02imbibed.02Now02he02was02in02a02state02
bordering02on02ecstasy,02and02all02that02he02had02drunk02seemed02to02
fly02to02his02head02with02redoubled02effect.02He02stood02with02the02
two02ladies,02seizing02both02by02their02hands,02persuading02them,02
least02 regard02
and02giving02them02reasons02with02astonishing02plainness02of02
speech,02and02at02almost02every02word02he02uttered,02probably02to02
emphasise02 his02 arguments,02 he02 squeezed02 their02 hands02
painfully02as02in02a02vise.02He02stared02at02Avdotya02Romanovna02
without02 the02
for02 good02 manners.02 They02
sometimes02pulled02their02hands02out02of02his02huge02bony02paws,02
but02far02from02noticing02what02was02the02matter,02he02drew02them02
all02the02closer02to02him.02If02they'd02told02him02to02jump02head02
foremost02from02the02staircase,02he02would02have02done02it02
without02thought02or02hesitation02in02their02service.02Though02
Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02felt02that02the02young02man02was02really02
too02eccentric02and02pinched02her02hand02too02much,02in02her02
anxiety02over02her02Rodya02she02looked02on02his02presence02as02
providential,02 and02 was02 unwilling02
to02 notice02 all02 his02
peculiarities.02But02though02Avdotya02Romanovna02shared02her02
anxiety,02and02was02not02of02timorous02disposition,02she02could02not02
see02the02glowing02light02in02his02eyes02without02wonder02and02
almost02alarm.02It02was02only02the02unbounded02confidence02
inspired02by02Nastasya's02account02of02her02brother's02queer02
friend,02which02prevented02her02from02trying02to02run02away02from02
him,02and02to02persuade02her02mother02to02do02the02same.02She02
realised,02too,02that02even02running02away02was02perhaps02
impossible02now.02Ten02minutes02later,02however,02she02was02
considerably02reassured;02it02was02characteristic02of02Razumihin02
that02he02showed02his02true02nature02at02once,02whatever02mood02he02
might02be02in,02so02that02people02quickly02saw02the02sort02of02man02
they02had02to02deal02with.0202
"You02can't02go02to02the02landlady,02that's02perfect02nonsense!"02
he02cried.02"If02you02stay,02though02you02are02his02mother,02you'll02
drive02him02to02a02frenzy,02and02then02goodness02knows02what02will02
happen!02Listen,02I'll02tell02you02what02I'll02do:02Nastasya02will02stay02
with02him02now,02and02I'll02conduct02you02both02home,02you02can't02

not02drunk;02he02is02not02drunk,02he02is02never02drunk!02I'll02drag02him02

and02I'll02tell02Zossimov02to02sleep02at02the02landlady's,02to02be02at02

home02then!02But02the02landlady02is02out02of02the02question;02it's02all02
right02for02me,02but02it's02out02of02the02question02for02you:02she02
wouldn't02take02you,02for02she's...02for02she's02a02fool...02She'd02be02

too,02if02you02want02to02know...02of02Avdotya02Romanovna02
certainly.02She02is02an02absolutely,02absolutely02unaccountable02
character!02But02I02am02a02fool,02too!...02No02matter!02Come02along!02
Do02you02trust02me?02Come,02do02you02trust02me02or02not?"0202
"Let02us02go,02mother,"02said02Avdotya02Romanovna,02"he02will02
certainly02do02what02he02has02promised.02He02has02saved02Rodya02
already,02and02if02the02doctor02really02will02consent02to02spend02the02
night02here,02what02could02be02better?"0202
"You02see,02you...02you...02understand02me,02because02you02are02

quarter02of02an02hour."0202
Though02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02was02not02perfectly02
convinced,02she02made02no02further02resistance.02Razumihin02
gave02an02arm02to02each02and02drew02them02down02the02stairs.02He02
still02made02her02uneasy,02as02though02he02was02competent02and02
good\natured,02was02he02capable02of02carrying02out02his02promise?02
He02seemed02in02such02a02condition....0202
"Ah,02I02see02you02think02I02am02in02such02a02condition!"02
Razumihin02broke02in02upon02her02thoughts,02guessing02them,02as02
he02strolled02along02the02pavement02with02huge02steps,02so02that02the02

"What02do02you02say?"02cried02the02mother.0202
"Did02the02doctor02really02say02that?"02asked02Avdotya02
Romanovna,02alarmed.0202
"Yes,02but02it's02not02so,02not02a02bit02of02it.02He02gave02him02some02

"Listen!"02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02interrupted02timidly,02
but02it02only02added02fuel02to02the02flames.0202
"What02do02you02think?"02shouted02Razumihin,02louder02than02

"Good02heavens,02Dounia,02what02is02going02to02happen?"02said02
Pulcheria02Alexandrovna,02addressing02her02daughter02with02
anxiety02and02dismay.0202
"Don't02worry02yourself,02mother,"02said02Dounia,02taking02off02
her02hat02and02cape.02"God02has02sent02this02gentleman02to02our02aid,02

"No,02it's02not02that,02mother.02You02didn't02see,02you02were02
crying02all02the02time.02He02is02quite02unhinged02by02serious02
illness―that's02the02reason."0202
"Ah,02that02illness!02What02will02happen,02what02will02happen?02
And02how02he02talked02to02you,02Dounia!"02said02the02mother,02
looking02timidly02at02her02daughter,02trying02to02read02her02
thoughts02and,02already02half02consoled02by02Dounia's02standing02
up02for02her02brother,02which02meant02that02she02had02already02
forgiven02him.02"I02am02sure02he02will02think02better02of02it02to\

"And02I02am02sure02that02he02will02say02the02same02to\morrow...02
about02that,"02Avdotya02Romanovna02said02finally.02And,02of02
course,02there02was02no02going02beyond02that,02for02this02was02a02
point02which02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02was02afraid02to02discuss.02
Dounia02went02up02and02kissed02her02mother.02The02latter02warmly02
embraced02her02without02speaking.02Then02she02sat02down02to02
wait02anxiously02for02Razumihin's02return,02timidly02watching02
her02daughter02who02walked02up02and02down02the02room02with02her02
arms02folded,02lost02in02thought.02This02walking02up02and02down02
when02 she02 was02 thinking02 was02 a02 habit02 of02 Avdotya02
Romanovna's02and02the02mother02was02always02afraid02to02break02
in02on02her02daughter's02mood02at02such02moments.0202
Razumihin,02of02course,02was02ridiculous02in02his02sudden02
drunken02infatuation02for02Avdotya02Romanovna.02Yet02apart02
from02his02eccentric02condition,02many02people02would02have02
thought02it02justified02if02they02had02seen02Avdotya02Romanovna,02
especially02at02that02moment02when02she02was02walking02to02and02
fro02with02folded02arms,02pensive02and02melancholy.02Avdotya02
Romanovna02was02remarkably02good02looking;02she02was02tall,02
strikingly02well\proportioned,02strong02and02self\reliant―the02
latter02quality02was02apparent02in02every02gesture,02though02it02did02
not02in02the02least02detract02from02the02grace02and02softness02of02her02
movements.02In02face02she02resembled02her02brother,02but02she02
might02be02described02as02really02beautiful.02Her02hair02was02dark02
brown,02a02little02lighter02than02her02brother's;02there02was02a02
proud02light02in02her02almost02black02eyes02and02yet02at02times02a02look02
of02extraordinary02kindness.02She02was02pale,02but02it02was02a02
healthy02pallor;02her02face02was02radiant02with02freshness02and02
vigour.02Her02mouth02was02rather02small;02the02full02red02lower02lip02
projected02a02little02as02did02her02chin;02it02was02the02only02
irregularity02in02her02beautiful02face,02but02it02gave02it02a02peculiarly02
individual02and02almost02haughty02expression.02Her02face02was02
always02more02serious02and02thoughtful02than02gay;02but02how02
well02smiles,02how02well02youthful,02lighthearted,02irresponsible,02
laughter02suited02her02face!02It02was02natural02enough02that02a02
warm,02open,02simple\hearted,02honest02giant02like02Razumihin,02
who02had02never02seen02anyone02like02her02and02was02not02quite02
sober02at02the02time,02should02lose02his02head02immediately.02
Besides,02as02chance02would02have02it,02he02saw02Dounia02for02the02
first02time02transfigured02by02her02love02for02her02brother02and02her02
joy02at02meeting02him.02Afterwards02he02saw02her02lower02lip02quiver02
with02indignation02at02her02brother's02insolent,02cruel02and02
ungrateful02words―and02his02fate02was02sealed.0202
He02had02spoken02the02truth,02moreover,02when02he02blurted02
out02in02his02drunken02talk02on02the02stairs02that02Praskovya02
Pavlovna,02Raskolnikov's02eccentric02landlady,02would02be02
jealous02of02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02as02well02as02of02Avdotya02
Romanovna02 on02 his02
account.02 Although02 Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna02was02forty\three,02her02face02still02retained02
traces02of02her02former02beauty;02she02looked02much02younger02
than02her02age,02indeed,02which02is02almost02always02the02case02with02
women02who02retain02serenity02of02spirit,02sensitiveness02and02
pure02sincere02warmth02of02heart02to02old02age.02We02may02add02in02
parenthesis02that02to02preserve02all02this02is02the02only02means02of02
retaining02beauty02to02old02age.02Her02hair02had02begun02to02grow02
grey02and02thin,02there02had02long02been02little02crow's02foot02
wrinkles02round02her02eyes,02her02cheeks02were02hollow02and02
sunken02from02anxiety02and02grief,02and02yet02it02was02a02handsome02
face.02She02was02Dounia02over02again,02twenty02years02older,02but02
without02the02projecting02underlip.02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02
was02emotional,02but02not02sentimental,02timid02and02yielding,02
but02only02to02a02certain02point.02She02could02give02way02and02accept02a02
great02deal02even02of02what02was02contrary02to02her02convictions,02
but02there02was02a02certain02barrier02fixed02by02honesty,02principle02
and02the02deepest02convictions02which02nothing02would02induce02
her02to02cross.0202
Exactly02twenty02minutes02after02Razumihin's02departure,02
there02came02two02subdued02but02hurried02knocks02at02the02door:02
he02had02come02back.0202
"I02won't02come02in,02I02haven't02time,"02he02hastened02to02say02
when02the02door02was02opened.02"He02sleeps02like02a02top,02soundly,02
quietly,02and02God02grant02he02may02sleep02ten02hours.02Nastasya's02
with02him;02I02told02her02not02to02leave02till02I02came.02Now02I02am02
fetching02Zossimov,02he02will02report02to02you02and02then02you'd02
better02turn02in;02I02can02see02you02are02too02tired02to02do02anything...."0202
And02he02ran02off02down02the02corridor.0202
"What02a02very02competent02and...02devoted02young02man!"02
cried02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02exceedingly02delighted.0202
"He02seems02a02splendid02person!"02Avdotya02Romanovna02
replied02with02some02warmth,02resuming02her02walk02up02and02
down02the02room.0202
It02was02nearly02an02hour02later02when02they02heard02footsteps02
in02the02corridor02and02another02knock02at02the02door.02Both02
relying02 on02
women02 waited02
Razumihin's02 promise;02 he02 actually02 had02 succeeded02
in02
bringing02Zossimov.02Zossimov02had02agreed02at02once02to02desert02
the02drinking02party02to02go02to02Raskolnikov's,02but02he02came02
reluctantly02and02with02the02greatest02suspicion02to02see02the02
ladies,02mistrusting02Razumihin02in02his02exhilarated02condition.02
time02 completely02
this02
But02his02vanity02was02at02once02reassured02and02flattered;02he02saw02
that02they02were02really02expecting02him02as02an02oracle.02He02stayed02
just02ten02minutes02and02succeeded02in02completely02convincing02
and02comforting02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna.02He02spoke02with02
marked02sympathy,02but02with02the02reserve02and02extreme02
important02
seriousness02 of02 a02 young02 doctor02 at02 an02
consultation.02He02did02not02utter02a02word02on02any02other02subject02
and02did02not02display02the02slightest02desire02to02enter02into02more02
personal02relations02with02the02two02ladies.02Remarking02at02his02
first02entrance02the02dazzling02beauty02of02Avdotya02Romanovna,02
he02endeavoured02not02to02notice02her02at02all02during02his02visit02and02
addressed02himself02solely02to02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna.02All02
this02gave02him02extraordinary02inward02satisfaction.02He02
declared02that02he02thought02the02invalid02at02this02moment02going02
on02very02satisfactorily.02According02to02his02observations02the02
patient's02illness02was02due02partly02to02his02unfortunate02material02
surroundings02during02the02last02few02months,02but02it02had02partly02
also02a02moral02origin,02"was,02so02to02speak,02the02product02of02
several02 material02 and02 moral02
influences,02 anxieties,02
apprehensions,02troubles,02certain02ideas...02and02so02on."02
Noticing02stealthily02that02Avdotya02Romanovna02was02following02
his02words02with02close02attention,02Zossimov02allowed02himself02
to02enlarge02on02this02theme.02On02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna's02
anxiously02and02timidly02inquiring02as02to02"some02suspicion02of02
insanity,"02he02replied02with02a02composed02and02candid02smile02
that02his02words02had02been02exaggerated;02that02certainly02the02
patient02had02some02fixed02idea,02something02approaching02a02
monomania―he,02Zossimov,02was02now02particularly02studying02
this02interesting02branch02of02medicine―but02that02it02must02be02
recollected02that02until02to\day02the02patient02had02been02in02
delirium02and...02and02that02no02doubt02the02presence02of02his02family02
would02have02a02favourable02effect02on02his02recovery02and02
distract02his02mind,02"if02only02all02fresh02shocks02can02be02avoided,"02
he02added02significantly.02Then02he02got02up,02took02leave02with02an02
impressive02 and02 affable02 bow,02 while02 blessings,02 warm02
gratitude,02and02entreaties02were02showered02upon02him,02and02
Avdotya02Romanovna02spontaneously02offered02her02hand02to02
him.02He02went02out02exceedingly02pleased02with02his02visit02and02
still02more02so02with02himself.0202
"We'll02talk02to\morrow;02go02to02bed02at02once!"02Razumihin02
said02in02conclusion,02following02Zossimov02out.02"I'll02be02with02
you02to\morrow02morning02as02early02as02possible02with02my02
report."0202
"That's02a02fetching02little02girl,02Avdotya02Romanovna,"02
remarked02Zossimov,02almost02licking02his02lips02as02they02both02
came02out02into02the02street.0202
"Fetching?02You02said02fetching?"02roared02Razumihin02and02
he02flew02at02Zossimov02and02seized02him02by02the02throat.02"If02you02
ever02dare....02Do02you02understand?02Do02you02understand?"02he02
shouted,02shaking02him02by02the02collar02and02squeezing02him02
against02the02wall.02"Do02you02hear?"0202
"Let02 me02 go,02 you02 drunken02devil,"02 said02 Zossimov,02
struggling02and02when02he02had02let02him02go,02he02stared02at02him02
and02went02off02into02a02sudden02guffaw.02Razumihin02stood02facing02
him02in02gloomy02and02earnest02reflection.0202
"Of02course,02I02am02an02ass,"02he02observed,02sombre02as02a02
storm02cloud,02"but02still...02you02are02another."0202
"No,02brother,02not02at02all02such02another.02I02am02not02dreaming02
of02any02folly."0202
They02walked02along02in02silence02and02only02when02they02were02
close02to02Raskolnikov's02lodgings,02Razumihin02broke02the02
silence02in02considerable02anxiety.0202
"Listen,"02he02said,02"you're02a02first\rate02fellow,02but02among02
your02other02failings,02you're02a02loose02fish,02that02I02know,02and02a02

"But02I02don't02think!"0202
"Here02you02have02modesty,02brother,02silence,02bashfulness,02

Zossimov02laughed02more02violently02than02ever.0202
"Well,02you02are02smitten!02But02what02am02I02to02do02with02her?"0202
"It02won't02be02much02trouble,02I02assure02you.02Talk02any02rot02

"But02have02you02made02her02some02promise?02Something02
signed?02A02promise02of02marriage,02perhaps?"0202
"Nothing,02nothing,02absolutely02nothing02of02the02kind!02
Besides02she02is02not02that02sort02at02all....02Tchebarov02tried02that...."0202
"Well02then,02drop02her!"0202
"But02I02can't02drop02her02like02that!"0202
"Why02can't02you?"0202
"Well,02I02can't,02that's02all02about02it!02There's02an02element02of02

"Then02why02have02you02fascinated02her?"0202
"I02haven't02fascinated02her;02perhaps02I02was02fascinated02

02
0202
Razumihin02waked02up02next02morning02at02eight02o'clock,02
troubled02and02serious.02He02found02himself02confronted02with02
many02new02and02unlooked\for02perplexities.02He02had02never02
expected02that02he02would02ever02wake02up02feeling02like02that.02He02
remembered02every02detail02of02the02previous02day02and02he02knew02
that02a02perfectly02novel02experience02had02befallen02him,02that02he02
had02received02an02impression02unlike02anything02he02had02known02
before.02At02the02same02time02he02recognised02clearly02that02the02
dream02which02had02fired02his02imagination02was02hopelessly02
unattainable―so02 unattainable02 that02 he02 felt02 positively02
ashamed02of02it,02and02he02hastened02to02pass02to02the02other02more02
practical02cares02and02difficulties02bequeathed02him02by02that02
"thrice02accursed02yesterday."0202
The02most02awful02recollection02of02the02previous02day02was02
the02way02he02had02shown02himself02"base02and02mean,"02not02only02
because02he02had02been02drunk,02but02because02he02had02taken02
advantage02of02the02young02girl's02position02to02abuse02her02fiancé02
in02his02stupid02jealousy,02knowing02nothing02of02their02mutual02
relations02and02obligations02and02next02to02nothing02of02the02man02
himself.02And02what02right02had02he02to02criticise02him02in02that02
hasty02and02unguarded02manner?02Who02had02asked02for02his02
opinion?02Was02it02thinkable02that02such02a02creature02as02Avdotya02
Romanovna02would02be02marrying02an02unworthy02man02for02
money?02So02there02must02be02something02in02him.02The02lodgings?02
But02after02all02how02could02he02know02the02character02of02the02
lodgings?02He02was02furnishing02a02flat...02Foo!02how02despicable02it02
all02was!02And02what02justification02was02it02that02he02was02drunk?02
Such02a02stupid02excuse02was02even02more02degrading!02In02wine02is02
truth,02and02the02truth02had02all02come02out,02"that02is,02all02the02
uncleanness02of02his02coarse02and02envious02heart"!02And02would02
such02a02dream02ever02be02permissible02to02him,02Razumihin?02
What02was02he02beside02such02a02girl―he,02the02drunken02noisy02
braggart02of02last02night?02Was02it02possible02to02imagine02so02
absurd02and02cynical02a02juxtaposition?02Razumihin02blushed02
desperately02at02the02very02idea02and02suddenly02the02recollection02
forced02itself02vividly02upon02him02of02how02he02had02said02last02night02
on02the02stairs02that02the02landlady02would02be02jealous02of02Avdotya02
Romanovna...02that02was02simply02intolerable.02He02brought02his02
fist02down02heavily02on02the02kitchen02stove,02hurt02his02hand02and02
sent02one02of02the02bricks02flying.0202
"Of02course,"02he02muttered02to02himself02a02minute02later02with02
a02feeling02of02self\abasement,02"of02course,02all02these02infamies02
can02never02be02wiped02out02or02smoothed02over...02and02so02it's02

and02do02my02duty...02in02silence,02too...02and02not02ask02forgiveness,02
and02say02nothing...02for02all02is02lost02now!"0202
And02yet02as02he02dressed02he02examined02his02attire02more02
carefully02than02usual.02He02hadn't02another02suit―if02he02had02had,02
perhaps02he02wouldn't02have02put02it02on.02"I02would02have02made02a02
point02of02not02putting02it02on."02But02in02any02case02he02could02not02
remain02a02cynic02and02a02dirty02sloven;02he02had02no02right02to02offend02
the02feelings02of02others,02especially02when02they02were02in02need02
of02his02assistance02and02asking02him02to02see02them.02He02brushed02
his02clothes02carefully.02His02linen02was02always02decent;02in02that02
respect02he02was02especially02clean.0202
He02washed02that02morning02scrupulously―he02got02some02
soap02from02Nastasya―he02washed02his02hair,02his02neck02and02
especially02his02hands.02When02it02came02to02the02question02
whether02to02shave02his02stubbly02chin02or02not02(Praskovya02
Pavlovna02had02capital02razors02that02had02been02left02by02her02late02
husband),02the02question02was02angrily02answered02in02the02
negative.02"Let02it02stay02as02it02is!02What02if02they02think02that02I02
shaved02on02purpose02to...?02They02certainly02would02think02so!02
Not02on02any02account!"0202
"And...02the02worst02of02it02was02he02was02so02coarse,02so02dirty,02he02
had02the02manners02of02a02pothouse;02and...02and02even02admitting02

He02was02engaged02in02such02monologues02when02Zossimov,02
who02had02spent02the02night02in02Praskovya02Pavlovna's02parlour,02
came02in.0202
He02was02going02home02and02was02in02a02hurry02to02look02at02the02
invalid02first.02Razumihin02informed02him02that02Raskolnikov02
was02sleeping02like02a02dormouse.02Zossimov02gave02orders02that02
they02shouldn't02wake02him02and02promised02to02see02him02again02
about02eleven.0202
"If02he02is02still02at02home,"02he02added.02"Damn02it02all!02If02one02

"But02I02am02not02a02father02confessor;02I02shall02come02and02go02
away;02I've02plenty02to02do02besides02looking02after02them."0202
"One02
thing02 worries02 me,"02
interposed02 Razumihin,02
frowning.02"On02the02way02home02I02talked02a02lot02of02drunken02
nonsense02to02him...02all02sorts02of02things...02and02amongst02them02
that02you02were02afraid02that02he...02might02become02insane."0202
"You02told02the02ladies02so,02too."0202
"I02know02it02was02stupid!02You02may02beat02me02if02you02like!02Did02
you02think02so02seriously?"0202
"That's02nonsense,02I02tell02you,02how02could02I02think02it02

Zametov's02story02that02cleared02up02half02the02mystery,02to02my02

Zametov02certainly02is02a02nice02fellow,02but02hm...02he02shouldn't02
have02told02all02that02last02night.02He02is02an02awful02chatterbox!"0202
"But02whom02did02he02tell02it02to?02You02and02me?"0202
"And02Porfiry."0202
"What02does02that02matter?"0202
"And,02by02the02way,02have02you02any02influence02on02them,02his02

"They'll02 get02 on02 all02 right!"02 Razumihin02 answered02
reluctantly.0202
"Why02is02he02so02set02against02this02Luzhin?02A02man02with02
money02and02she02doesn't02seem02to02dislike02him...02and02they02
haven't02a02farthing,02I02suppose?02eh?"0202
"But02what02business02is02it02of02yours?"02Razumihin02cried02
with02annoyance.02"How02can02I02tell02whether02they've02a02

she02was02up02at02seven02o'clock,02the02samovar02was02taken02into02
her02from02the02kitchen.02I02was02not02vouchsafed02a02personal02
interview...."0202
At02nine02o'clock02precisely02Razumihin02reached02the02
lodgings02at02Bakaleyev's02house.02Both02ladies02were02waiting02
for02him02with02nervous02impatience.02They02had02risen02at02seven02
o'clock02or02earlier.02He02entered02looking02as02black02as02night,02
bowed02awkwardly02and02was02at02once02furious02with02himself02
for02it.02He02had02reckoned02without02his02host:02Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna02fairly02rushed02at02him,02seized02him02by02both02
hands02and02was02almost02kissing02them.02He02glanced02timidly02at02
Avdotya02Romanovna,02but02her02proud02countenance02wore02at02
that02 moment02 an02 expression02 of02 such02 gratitude02 and02
friendliness,02such02complete02and02unlooked\for02respect02(in02
place02of02the02sneering02looks02and02ill\disguised02contempt02he02
had02expected),02that02it02threw02him02into02greater02confusion02
than02if02he02had02been02met02with02abuse.02Fortunately02there02was02
a02subject02for02conversation,02and02he02made02haste02to02snatch02at02
it.0202Hearing02that02everything02was02going02well02and02that02Rodya02
had02not02yet02waked,02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02declared02that02
she02was02glad02to02hear02it,02because02"she02had02something02which02
it02was02very,02very02necessary02to02talk02over02beforehand."02Then02
followed02an02inquiry02about02breakfast02and02an02invitation02to02
have02it02with02them;02they02had02waited02to02have02it02with02him.02
Avdotya02Romanovna02rang02the02bell:02it02was02answered02by02a02
ragged02dirty02waiter,02and02they02asked02him02to02bring02tea02which02
was02served02at02last,02but02in02such02a02dirty02and02disorderly02way02
that02the02ladies02were02ashamed.02Razumihin02vigorously02
attacked02the02lodgings,02but,02remembering02Luzhin,02stopped02
in02embarrassment02and02was02greatly02relieved02by02Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna's02questions,02which02showered02in02a02continual02
stream02upon02him.0202
He02talked02 for02three02 quarters02of02an02hour,02being02
constantly02interrupted02by02their02questions,02and02succeeded02
in02describing02to02them02all02the02most02important02facts02he02knew02
of02the02last02year02of02Raskolnikov's02life,02concluding02with02a02
circumstantial02account02of02his02illness.02He02omitted,02however,02
many02things,02which02were02better02omitted,02including02the02
scene02at02the02police02station02with02all02its02consequences.02They02
listened02eagerly02to02his02story,02and,02when02he02thought02he02had02
finished02and02satisfied02his02listeners,02he02found02that02they02
considered02he02had02hardly02begun.0202
"Tell02me,02tell02me!02What02do02you02think...?02Excuse02me,02I02still02
don't02know02your02name!"02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02put02in02
hastily.0202
"Dmitri02Prokofitch."0202
"I02should02like02very,02very02much02to02know,02Dmitri02
Prokofitch...02how02he02looks...02on02things02in02general02now,02that02
is,02how02can02I02explain,02what02are02his02likes02and02dislikes?02Is02he02
always02so02irritable?02Tell02me,02if02you02can,02what02are02his02hopes02
and,02so02to02say,02his02dreams?02Under02what02influences02is02he02
now?02In02a02word,02I02should02like..."0202
"Ah,02mother,02how02can02he02answer02all02that02at02once?"02
observed02Dounia.0202
"Good02heavens,02I02had02not02expected02to02find02him02in02the02
least02like02this,02Dmitri02Prokofitch!"0202
"Naturally,"02answered02Razumihin.02"I02have02no02mother,02
but02my02uncle02comes02every02year02and02almost02every02time02he02

is02a02clever02man;02and02your02three02years'02separation02means02a02
great02deal.02What02am02I02to02tell02you?02I02have02known02Rodion02for02
a02year02and02a02half;02he02is02morose,02gloomy,02proud02and02
haughty,02and02of02late―and02perhaps02for02a02long02time02
before―he02has02been02suspicious02and02fanciful.02He02has02a02
noble02nature02and02a02kind02heart.02He02does02not02like02showing02
his02feelings02and02would02rather02do02a02cruel02thing02than02open02
his02heart02freely.02Sometimes,02though,02he02is02not02at02all02morbid,02
but02simply02cold02and02inhumanly02callous;02it's02as02though02he02
were02alternating02between02two02characters.02Sometimes02he02is02
fearfully02reserved!02He02says02he02is02so02busy02that02everything02is02
a02hindrance,02and02yet02he02lies02in02bed02doing02nothing.02He02
doesn't02jeer02at02things,02not02because02he02hasn't02the02wit,02but02as02
though02he02hadn't02time02to02waste02on02such02trifles.02He02never02
listens02to02what02is02said02to02him.02He02is02never02interested02in02
what02interests02other02people02at02any02given02moment.02He02
thinks02very02highly02of02himself02and02perhaps02he02is02right.02Well,02
what02more?02I02think02your02arrival02will02have02a02most02beneficial02
influence02upon02him."0202
"God02grant02it02may,"02cried02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna,02
distressed02by02Razumihin's02account02of02her02Rodya.0202
And02Razumihin02ventured02to02look02more02boldly02at02
Avdotya02Romanovna02at02last.02He02glanced02at02her02often02while02
he02was02talking,02but02only02for02a02moment02and02looked02away02
again02at02once.02Avdotya02Romanovna02sat02at02the02table,02
listening02attentively,02then02got02up02again02and02began02walking02
to02and02fro02with02her02arms02folded02and02her02lips02compressed,02
occasionally02putting02in02a02question,02without02stopping02her02
walk.02She02had02the02same02habit02of02not02listening02to02what02was02
said.02She02was02wearing02a02dress02of02thin02dark02stuff02and02she02
had02a02white02transparent02scarf02round02her02neck.02Razumihin02
soon02 detected02 signs02 of02 extreme02 poverty02
their02
belongings.02Had02Avdotya02Romanovna02been02dressed02like02a02
queen,02he02felt02that02he02would02not02be02afraid02of02her,02but02
perhaps02just02because02she02was02poorly02dressed02and02that02he02
noticed02all02the02misery02of02her02surroundings,02his02heart02was02
filled02with02dread02and02he02began02to02be02afraid02of02every02word02
he02uttered,02every02gesture02he02made,02which02was02very02trying02
for02a02man02who02already02felt02diffident.0202
"You've02told02us02a02great02deal02that02is02interesting02about02my02
brother's02character...02and02have02told02it02impartially.02I02am02
glad.02I02thought02that02you02were02too02uncritically02devoted02to02
him,"02observed02Avdotya02Romanovna02with02a02smile.02"I02think02
you02are02right02that02he02needs02a02woman's02care,"02she02added02
thoughtfully.0202
"I02didn't02say02so;02but02I02daresay02you02are02right,02only..."0202
"What?"0202
"He02
loves02 no02 one02 and02 perhaps02 he02 never02 will,"02
Razumihin02declared02decisively.0202
in02
"You02mean02he02is02not02capable02of02love?"0202
"Do02you02know,02Avdotya02Romanovna,02you02are02awfully02
like02your02brother,02in02everything,02indeed!"02he02blurted02out02
suddenly02to02his02own02surprise,02but02remembering02at02once02
what02he02had02just02before02said02of02her02brother,02he02turned02as02
red02as02a02crab02and02was02overcome02with02confusion.02Avdotya02
Romanovna02couldn't02help02laughing02when02she02looked02at02
him.0202"You02may02both02be02mistaken02about02Rodya,"02Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna02remarked,02slightly02piqued.02"I02am02not02talking02
of02our02present02difficulty,02Dounia.02What02Pyotr02Petrovitch02

depend02on02what02he02would02do02when02he02was02only02fifteen.02

idea02of02marrying02that02girl―what02was02her02name―his02
landlady's02daughter?"0202
"Did02you02hear02about02that02affair?"02asked02Avdotya02
Romanovna.0202
"Do02 you02
suppose――"02 Pulcheria02 Alexandrovna02
continued02warmly.02"Do02you02suppose02that02my02tears,02my02
entreaties,02my02illness,02my02possible02death02from02grief,02our02

have02disregarded02all02obstacles.02And02yet02it02isn't02that02he02
doesn't02love02us!"0202
"He02has02never02spoken02a02word02of02that02affair02to02me,"02
Razumihin02answered02cautiously.02"But02I02did02hear02something02
from02Praskovya02Pavlovna02herself,02though02she02is02by02no02
means02a02gossip.02And02what02I02heard02certainly02was02rather02
strange."0202
"And02what02did02you02hear?"02both02the02ladies02asked02at02once.0202
"Well,02nothing02very02special.02I02only02learned02that02the02

positively02ugly...02and02such02an02invalid...02and02queer.02But02she02
seems02to02have02had02some02good02qualities.02She02must02have02had02

"I02am02sure02she02was02a02good02girl,"02Avdotya02Romanovna02
observed02briefly.0202
"God02forgive02me,02I02simply02rejoiced02at02her02death.02Though02
I02don't02know02which02of02them02would02have02caused02most02
misery02to02the02other―he02to02her02or02she02to02him,"02Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna02concluded.02Then02she02began02tentatively02
questioning02him02about02the02scene02on02the02previous02day02with02
Luzhin,02hesitating02and02continually02glancing02at02Dounia,02
obviously02to02the02latter's02annoyance.02This02incident02more02
than02all02the02rest02evidently02caused02her02uneasiness,02even02
consternation.02Razumihin02described02it02in02detail02again,02but02
this02time02he02added02his02own02conclusions:02he02openly02blamed02
Raskolnikov02for02intentionally02insulting02Pyotr02Petrovitch,02
not02seeking02to02excuse02him02on02the02score02of02his02illness.0202
"He02had02planned02it02before02his02illness,"02he02added.0202
"I02think02so,02too,"02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02agreed02with02a02
dejected02air.02But02she02was02very02much02surprised02at02hearing02
Razumihin02express02himself02so02carefully02and02even02with02a02
certain02
respect02 about02 Pyotr02 Petrovitch.02 Avdotya02
Romanovna,02too,02was02struck02by02it.0202
and02
ceased02
"So02this02is02your02opinion02of02Pyotr02Petrovitch?"02Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna02could02not02resist02asking.0202
"I02can02have02no02other02opinion02of02your02daughter's02future02
husband,"02Razumihin02answered02firmly02and02with02warmth,02
"and02I02don't02say02it02simply02from02vulgar02politeness,02but02
because...02simply02because02Avdotya02Romanovna02has02of02her02
own02free02will02deigned02to02accept02this02man.02If02I02spoke02so02

completely...02and02this02morning02I02am02ashamed02of02it."0202
He02
speaking.02 Avdotya02
crimsoned02
Romanovna02flushed,02but02did02not02break02the02silence.02She02had02
not02uttered02a02word02from02the02moment02they02began02to02speak02
of02Luzhin.0202
Without02her02support02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02obviously02
did02not02know02what02to02do.02At02last,02faltering02and02continually02
glancing02at02her02daughter,02she02confessed02that02she02was02
exceedingly02worried02by02one02circumstance.0202
"You02see,02Dmitri02Prokofitch,"02she02began.02"I'll02be02
perfectly02open02with02Dmitri02Prokofitch,02Dounia?"0202
"Of02 course,02 mother,"02 said02 Avdotya02 Romanovna02
emphatically.0202
"This02is02what02it02is,"02she02began02in02haste,02as02though02the02
permission02to02speak02of02her02trouble02lifted02a02weight02off02her02
mind.02"Very02early02this02morning02we02got02a02note02from02Pyotr02

"What02am02I02to02do02now,02Dmitri02Prokofitch?"02began02
Pulcheria02Alexandrovna,02almost02weeping.02"How02can02I02ask02

"Act02on02Avdotya02Romanovna's02decision,"02Razumihin02

"Which02cost02you02such02sacrifice,02mother,"02put02in02Avdotya02
Romanovna.0202
"He02 was02 not02 himself02 yesterday,"02 Razumihin02 said02
thoughtfully,02"if02you02only02knew02what02he02was02up02to02in02a02

enamelled02watch02which02hung02round02her02neck02on02a02thin02
Venetian02chain,02and02looked02entirely02out02of02keeping02with02
the02rest02of02her02dress.02"A02present02from02her02fiancé,"02thought02
Razumihin.0202
"We02must02start,02Dounia,02we02must02start,"02her02mother02
cried02in02a02flutter.02"He02will02be02thinking02we02are02still02angry02
after02 yesterday,02 from02 our02 coming02 so02
late.02 Merciful02
heavens!"0202
While02she02said02this02she02was02hurriedly02putting02on02her02
hat02and02mantle;02Dounia,02too,02put02on02her02things.02Her02gloves,02
as02Razumihin02noticed,02were02not02merely02shabby02but02had02
holes02in02them,02and02yet02this02evident02poverty02gave02the02two02
ladies02an02air02of02special02dignity,02which02is02always02found02in02
people02who02know02how02to02wear02poor02clothes.02Razumihin02
looked02reverently02at02Dounia02and02felt02proud02of02escorting02
her.02"The02queen02who02mended02her02stockings02in02prison,"02he02
thought,02"must02have02looked02then02every02inch02a02queen02and02
even02more02a02queen02than02at02sumptuous02banquets02and02

"My02God!"02exclaimed02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna,02"little02did02
I02think02that02I02should02ever02fear02seeing02my02son,02my02darling,02

glancing02at02him02timidly.0202
"Don't02be02afraid,02mother,"02said02Dounia,02kissing02her,02
"better02have02faith02in02him."0202
"Oh,02dear,02I02have02faith02in02him,02but02I02haven't02slept02all02

They02came02out02into02the02street.0202
"Do02you02know,02Dounia,02when02I02dozed02a02little02this02

Dmitri02Prokofitch,02that02Marfa02Petrovna's02dead!"0202
"No,02I02didn't02know;02who02is02Marfa02Petrovna?"0202
"She02died02suddenly;02and02only02fancy..."0202
"Afterwards,02mamma,"02put02in02Dounia.02"He02doesn't02know02
who02Marfa02Petrovna02is."0202
"Ah,02you02don't02know?02And02I02was02thinking02that02you02knew02

what's02the02matter02with02your02right02hand?02Have02you02knocked02
it?"0202"Yes,02I02bruised02it,"02muttered02Razumihin02overjoyed.0202
"I02sometimes02speak02too02much02from02the02heart,02so02that02
Dounia02finds02fault02with02me....02But,02dear02me,02what02a02

Prokofitch,02how02am02I02to02treat02him?02I02feel02quite02distracted,02
you02know."0202
"Don't02question02him02too02much02about02anything02if02you02see02
him02frown;02don't02ask02him02too02much02about02his02health;02he02
doesn't02like02that."0202
"Ah,02Dmitri02Prokofitch,02how02hard02it02is02to02be02a02mother!02
But02here02are02the02stairs....02What02an02awful02staircase!"0202
"Mother,02you02are02quite02pale,02don't02distress02yourself,02
darling,"02said02Dounia02caressing02her,02then02with02flashing02

you02are02tormenting02yourself02so."0202
"Wait,02I'll02peep02in02and02see02whether02he02has02waked02up."0202
The02ladies02slowly02followed02Razumihin,02who02went02on02
before,02and02when02they02reached02the02landlady's02door02on02the02
fourth02storey,02they02noticed02that02her02door02was02a02tiny02crack02
open02and02that02two02keen02black02eyes02were02watching02them02
from02the02darkness02within.02When02their02eyes02met,02the02door02
was02suddenly02shut02with02such02a02slam02that02Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna02almost02cried02out.0202
02
0202
CHAPTER02III0202
"He02is02well,02quite02well!"02Zossimov02cried02cheerfully02as02
they02entered.0202
He02had02come02in02ten02minutes02earlier02and02was02sitting02in02
the02same02place02as02before,02on02the02sofa.02Raskolnikov02was02
sitting02in02the02opposite02corner,02fully02dressed02and02carefully02
washed02and02combed,02as02he02had02not02been02for02some02time02
past.02The02room02was02immediately02crowded,02yet02Nastasya02
managed02to02follow02the02visitors02in02and02stayed02to02listen.0202
Raskolnikov02really02was02almost02well,02as02compared02with02
his02condition02the02day02before,02but02he02was02still02pale,02listless,02
and02sombre.02He02looked02like02a02wounded02man02or02one02who02
has02undergone02some02terrible02physical02suffering.02His02brows02
were02knitted,02his02lips02compressed,02his02eyes02feverish.02He02
spoke02little02and02reluctantly,02as02though02performing02a02duty,02
and02there02was02a02restlessness02in02his02movements.0202
He02only02wanted02a02sling02on02his02arm02or02a02bandage02on02his02
finger02to02complete02the02impression02of02a02man02with02a02painful02
abscess02or02a02broken02arm.02The02pale,02sombre02face02lighted02up02
for02a02moment02when02his02mother02and02sister02entered,02but02this02
only02gave02it02a02look02of02more02intense02suffering,02in02place02of02its02
listless02dejection.02The02light02soon02died02away,02but02the02look02of02
suffering02remained,02and02Zossimov,02watching02and02studying02
his02patient02with02all02the02zest02of02a02young02doctor02beginning02to02
practise,02noticed02in02him02no02joy02at02the02arrival02of02his02mother02
and02sister,02but02a02sort02of02bitter,02hidden02determination02to02
bear02another02hour02or02two02of02inevitable02torture.02He02saw02
later02that02almost02every02word02of02the02following02conversation02
seemed02to02touch02on02some02sore02place02and02irritate02it.02But02at02
the02same02time02he02marvelled02at02the02power02of02controlling02
himself02and02hiding02his02feelings02in02a02patient02who02the02
previous02day02had,02like02a02monomaniac,02fallen02into02a02frenzy02
at02the02slightest02word.0202
"Yes,02I02see02myself02now02that02I02am02almost02well,"02said02
Raskolnikov,02giving02his02mother02and02sister02a02kiss02of02
welcome02which02made02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02radiant02at02
once.02"And02I02don't02say02this02 as02 I02 did02 yesterday,"02he02said,02
addressing02Razumihin,02with02a02friendly02pressure02of02his02

"Yes,02indeed,02I02am02quite02surprised02at02him02to\day,"02began02
Zossimov,02much02delighted02at02the02ladies'02entrance,02for02he02
had02not02succeeded02in02keeping02up02a02conversation02with02his02
patient02for02ten02minutes.02"In02another02three02or02four02days,02if02
he02goes02on02like02this,02he02will02be02just02as02before,02that02is,02as02he02
was02a02month02ago,02or02two...02or02perhaps02even02three.02This02has02
been02coming02on02for02a02long02while....02eh?02Confess,02now,02that02it02
has02been02perhaps02your02own02fault?"02he02added,02with02a02
tentative02smile,02as02though02still02afraid02of02irritating02him.0202
"It02is02very02possible,"02answered02Raskolnikov02coldly.0202
"I02should02say,02too,"02continued02Zossimov02with02zest,02"that02
your02complete02recovery02depends02solely02on02yourself.02Now02
that02one02can02talk02to02you,02I02should02like02to02impress02upon02you02
that02it02is02essential02to02avoid02the02elementary,02so02to02speak,02
fundamental02causes02tending02to02produce02your02morbid02
condition:02in02that02case02you02will02be02cured,02if02not,02it02will02go02
from02bad02to02worse.02These02fundamental02causes02I02don't02
know,02but02they02must02be02known02to02you.02You02are02an02
intelligent02man,02and02must02have02observed02yourself,02of02
course.02I02fancy02the02first02stage02of02your02derangement02
coincides02with02your02leaving02the02university.02You02must02not02
be02left02without02occupation,02and02so,02work02and02a02definite02aim02
set02before02you02might,02I02fancy,02be02very02beneficial."0202
"Yes,02yes;02you02are02perfectly02right....02I02will02make02haste02
and02return02to02the02university:02and02then02everything02will02go02
smoothly...."0202
Zossimov,02who02had02begun02his02sage02advice02partly02to02
make02an02effect02before02the02ladies,02was02certainly02somewhat02
mystified,02when,02glancing02at02his02patient,02he02observed02
unmistakable02mockery02on02his02face.02This02lasted02an02instant,02
however.02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02began02at02once02thanking02
Zossimov,02especially02for02his02visit02to02their02lodging02the02
previous02night.0202
"What!02he02saw02you02last02night?"02Raskolnikov02asked,02as02
though02startled.02"Then02you02have02not02slept02either02after02your02
journey."0202
"Ach,02Rodya,02that02was02only02till02two02o'clock.02Dounia02and02I02
never02go02to02bed02before02two02at02home."0202
"I02don't02know02how02to02thank02him02either,"02Raskolnikov02
went02on,02suddenly02frowning02and02looking02down.02"Setting02
aside02the02question02of02payment―forgive02me02for02referring02to02
it02(he02turned02to02Zossimov)―I02really02don't02know02what02I02
have02done02to02deserve02such02special02attention02from02you!02I02
simply02don't02understand02it...02and...02and...02it02weighs02upon02me,02
indeed,02because02I02don't02understand02it.02I02tell02you02so02
candidly."0202
"Don't02be02irritated."02Zossimov02forced02himself02to02laugh.02
"Assume02that02you02are02my02first02patient―well―we02fellows02
just02beginning02to02practise02love02our02first02patients02as02if02they02
were02our02children,02and02some02almost02fall02in02love02with02them.02
And,02of02course,02I02am02not02rich02in02patients."0202
"I02say02nothing02about02him,"02added02Raskolnikov,02pointing02
to02Razumihin,02"though02he02has02had02nothing02from02me02either02
but02insult02and02trouble."0202
"What02nonsense02he02is02talking!02Why,02you02are02in02a02
sentimental02mood02to\day,02are02you?"02shouted02Razumihin.0202
If02he02had02had02more02penetration02he02would02have02seen02
that02there02was02no02trace02of02sentimentality02in02him,02but02
something02
indeed02 quite02 the02 opposite.02 But02 Avdotya02
Romanovna02noticed02it.02She02was02intently02and02uneasily02
watching02her02brother.0202
"As02for02you,02mother,02I02don't02dare02to02speak,"02he02went02on,02
as02though02repeating02a02lesson02learned02by02heart.02"It02is02only02
to\day02that02I02have02been02able02to02realise02a02little02how02
distressed02you02must02have02been02here02yesterday,02waiting02for02
me02to02come02back."0202
When02he02had02said02this,02he02suddenly02held02out02his02hand02to02
his02sister,02smiling02without02a02word.02But02in02this02smile02there02
was02a02flash02of02real02unfeigned02feeling.02Dounia02caught02it02at02
once,02and02warmly02pressed02his02hand,02overjoyed02and02
thankful.02It02was02the02first02time02he02had02addressed02her02since02
their02dispute02the02previous02day.02The02mother's02face02lighted02
up02with02ecstatic02happiness02at02the02sight02of02this02conclusive02
unspoken02reconciliation.02"Yes,02that02is02what02I02love02him02for,"02
Razumihin,02exaggerating02it02all,02muttered02to02himself,02with02a02
vigorous02turn02in02his02chair.02"He02has02these02movements."0202
"And02how02well02he02does02it02all,"02the02mother02was02thinking02
to02herself.02"What02generous02impulses02he02has,02and02how02
simply,02 how02 delicately02 he02 put02 an02 end02 to02 all02 the02
misunderstanding02with02his02sister―simply02by02holding02out02
his02hand02at02the02right02minute02and02looking02at02her02like02that....02
And02what02fine02eyes02he02has,02and02how02fine02his02whole02face02
is!...02He02is02even02better02looking02than02Dounia....02But,02good02
heavens,02what02a02suit―how02terribly02he's02dressed!...02Vasya,02
the02messenger02boy02in02Afanasy02Ivanitch's02shop,02is02better02
dressed!02I02could02rush02at02him02and02hug02him...02weep02over02
him―but02I02am02afraid....02Oh,02dear,02he's02so02strange!02He's02
talking02kindly,02but02I'm02afraid!02Why,02what02am02I02afraid02of?..."0202
"Oh,02Rodya,02you02wouldn't02believe,"02she02began02suddenly,02
in02haste02to02answer02his02words02to02her,02"how02unhappy02Dounia02
and02I02were02yesterday!02Now02that02it's02all02over02and02done02with02
and02we02are02quite02happy02again―I02can02tell02you.02Fancy,02we02
ran02here02almost02straight02from02the02train02to02embrace02you02
and02 that02 woman―ah,02 here02 she02
is!02 Good02 morning,02
Nastasya!...02She02told02us02at02once02that02you02were02lying02in02a02
high02fever02and02had02just02run02away02from02the02doctor02in02
delirium,02and02they02were02looking02for02you02in02the02streets.02You02
can't02imagine02how02we02felt!02I02couldn't02help02thinking02of02the02
tragic02end02of02Lieutenant02Potanchikov,02a02friend02of02your02
father's―you02can't02remember02him,02Rodya―who02ran02out02
in02the02same02way02in02a02high02fever02and02fell02into02the02well02in02the02
court\yard02and02they02couldn't02pull02him02out02till02next02day.02Of02
course,02we02exaggerated02things.02We02were02on02the02point02of02
rushing02to02find02Pyotr02Petrovitch02to02ask02him02to02help....02
Because02we02were02alone,02utterly02alone,"02she02said02plaintively02
and02stopped02short,02suddenly,02recollecting02it02was02still02
somewhat02 dangerous02 to02 speak02 of02 Pyotr02 Petrovitch,02
although02"we02are02quite02happy02again."0202
"Yes,02yes....02Of02course02it's02very02annoying...."02Raskolnikov02
muttered02in02reply,02but02with02such02a02preoccupied02and02
inattentive02air02that02Dounia02gazed02at02him02in02perplexity.0202
"What02else02was02it02I02wanted02to02say?"02He02went02on02trying02
to02recollect.02"Oh,02yes;02mother,02and02you02too,02Dounia,02please02
don't02think02that02I02didn't02mean02to02come02and02see02you02to\day02
and02was02waiting02for02you02to02come02first."0202
"What02 are02 you02 saying,02 Rodya?"02 cried02 Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna.02She,02too,02was02surprised.0202
"Is02he02answering02us02as02a02duty?"02Dounia02wondered.02"Is02
he02being02reconciled02and02asking02forgiveness02as02though02he02
were02performing02a02rite02or02repeating02a02lesson?"0202
"I've02only02just02waked02up,02and02wanted02to02go02to02you,02but02
was02delayed02owing02to02my02clothes;02I02forgot02yesterday02to02ask02
her...02Nastasya...02to02wash02out02the02blood...02I've02only02just02
dressed."0202
"Blood!02What02blood?"02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02asked02in02
alarm.0202
"Oh,02nothing―don't02be02uneasy.02It02was02when02I02was02
wandering02about02yesterday,02rather02delirious,02I02chanced02
upon02a02man02who02had02been02run02over...02a02clerk..."0202
"Delirious?02But02you02remember02everything!"02Razumihin02
interrupted.0202
"That's02 true,"02 Raskolnikov02 answered02 with02 special02
carefulness.02"I02remember02everything02even02to02the02slightest02
detail,02and02yet―why02I02did02that02and02went02there02and02said02
that,02I02can't02clearly02explain02now."0202
"A02
familiar02 phenomenon,"02
interposed02 Zossimov,02
"actions02are02sometimes02performed02in02a02masterly02and02most02
cunning02way,02while02the02direction02of02the02actions02is02deranged02
and02dependent02on02various02morbid02impressions―it's02like02a02
dream."0202
"Perhaps02it's02a02good02thing02really02that02he02should02think02
me02almost02a02madman,"02thought02Raskolnikov.0202
"Why,02people02in02perfect02health02act02in02the02same02way02too,"02
observed02Dounia,02looking02uneasily02at02Zossimov.0202
"There02is02some02truth02in02your02observation,"02the02latter02
replied.02"In02that02sense02we02are02certainly02all02not02infrequently02
like02madmen,02but02with02the02slight02difference02that02the02
deranged02are02somewhat02madder,02for02we02must02draw02a02line.02
A02normal02man,02it02is02true,02hardly02exists.02Among02dozens―
perhaps02hundreds02of02thousands―hardly02one02is02to02be02met02
with."0202At02
the02 word02 "madman,"02 carelessly02 dropped02 by02
Zossimov02in02his02chatter02on02his02favourite02subject,02everyone02
frowned.0202
Raskolnikov02sat02seeming02not02to02pay02attention,02plunged02
in02thought02with02a02strange02smile02on02his02pale02lips.02He02was02
still02meditating02on02something.0202
"Well,02what02about02the02man02who02was02run02over?02I02
interrupted02you!"02Razumihin02cried02hastily.0202
"What?"02Raskolnikov02seemed02to02wake02up.02"Oh...02I02got02
spattered02with02blood02helping02to02carry02him02to02his02lodging.02
By02the02way,02mamma,02I02did02an02unpardonable02thing02
yesterday.02I02was02literally02out02of02my02mind.02I02gave02away02all02
the02money02you02sent02me...02to02his02wife02for02the02funeral.02She's02a02
widow02now,02in02consumption,02a02poor02creature...02three02little02
children,02starving...02nothing02in02the02house...02there's02a02
daughter,02too...02perhaps02you'd02have02given02it02yourself02if02
you'd02seen02them.02But02I02had02no02right02to02do02it02I02admit,02
especially02as02I02knew02how02you02needed02the02money02yourself.02
To02help02others02one02must02have02the02right02to02do02it,02or02else02
Crevez,02 chiens,02 si02 vous02 n'êtes02 pas02 contents."02He02laughed,02
"That's02right,02isn't02it,02Dounia?"0202
"No,02it's02not,"02answered02Dounia02firmly.0202
"Bah!02you,02too,02have02ideals,"02he02muttered,02looking02at02her02
almost02with02hatred,02and02smiling02sarcastically.02"I02ought02to02
have02considered02that....02Well,02that's02praiseworthy,02and02it's02
better02for02you...02and02if02you02reach02a02line02you02won't02overstep,02
you02will02be02unhappy...02and02if02you02overstep02it,02maybe02you02
will02be02still02unhappier....02But02all02that's02nonsense,"02he02added02
irritably,02vexed02at02being02carried02away.02"I02only02meant02to02say02
that02I02beg02your02forgiveness,02mother,"02he02concluded,02shortly02
and02abruptly.0202
"That's02enough,02Rodya,02I02am02sure02that02everything02you02
do02is02very02good,"02said02his02mother,02delighted.0202
"Don't02be02too02sure,"02he02answered,02twisting02his02mouth02
into02a02smile.0202
A02silence02followed.02There02was02a02certain02constraint02in02all02
this02 conversation,02 and02
in02 the02
in02 the02 silence,02 and02
reconciliation,02and02in02the02forgiveness,02and02all02were02feeling02
it.0202"It02is02as02though02they02were02afraid02of02me,"02Raskolnikov02
was02thinking02to02himself,02looking02askance02at02his02mother02and02
sister.02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02was02indeed02growing02more02
timid02the02longer02she02kept02silent.0202
"Yet02in02their02absence02I02seemed02to02love02them02so02much,"02
flashed02through02his02mind.0202
suddenly,"02
"Do02you02know,02Rodya,02Marfa02Petrovna02is02dead,"02
Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02suddenly02blurted02out.0202
"What02Marfa02Petrovna?"0202
"Oh,02mercy02on02us―Marfa02Petrovna02Svidriga07lov.02I02wrote02
you02so02much02about02her."0202
"A\a\h!02Yes,02I02remember....02So02she's02dead!02Oh,02really?"02he02
roused02himself02suddenly,02as02if02waking02up.02"What02did02she02
die02of?"0202
quite02
"Only02
Pulcheria02
imagine,02
Alexandrovna02answered02hurriedly,02encouraged02by02his02
curiosity.02"On02the02very02day02I02was02sending02you02that02letter!02
Would02you02believe02it,02that02awful02man02seems02to02have02been02
the02cause02of02her02death.02They02say02he02beat02her02dreadfully."0202
"Why,02were02they02on02such02bad02terms?"02he02asked,02
addressing02his02sister.0202
"Not02at02all.02Quite02the02contrary02indeed.02With02her,02he02was02
always02very02patient,02considerate02even.02In02fact,02all02those02
seven02years02of02their02married02life02he02gave02way02to02her,02too02
much02so02indeed,02in02many02cases.02All02of02a02sudden02he02seems02to02
have02lost02patience."0202
"Then02he02could02not02have02been02so02awful02if02he02controlled02
himself02for02seven02years?02You02seem02to02be02defending02him,02
Dounia?"0202
"No,02no,02he's02an02awful02man!02I02can02imagine02nothing02more02
awful!"02Dounia02answered,02almost02with02a02shudder,02knitting02
her02brows,02and02sinking02into02thought.0202
"That02 had02 happened02
in02 the02 morning,"02 Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna02went02on02hurriedly.02"And02directly02afterwards02
she02ordered02the02horses02to02be02harnessed02to02drive02to02the02
town02immediately02after02dinner.02She02always02used02to02drive02
to02the02town02in02such02cases.02She02ate02a02very02good02dinner,02I02am02

"After02the02beating?"0202
"That02was02always02her...02habit;02and02immediately02after02
dinner,02so02as02not02to02be02late02in02starting,02she02went02to02the02
bath\house....02 You02 see,02 she02 was02 undergoing02 some02
treatment02with02baths.02They02have02a02cold02spring02there,02and02
she02used02to02bathe02in02it02regularly02every02day,02and02no02sooner02
had02she02got02into02the02water02when02she02suddenly02had02a02
stroke!"0202
"I02should02think02so,"02said02Zossimov.0202
"And02did02he02beat02her02badly?"0202
"What02does02that02matter!"02put02in02Dounia.0202
"H'm!02But02I02don't02know02why02you02want02to02tell02us02such02
gossip,02mother,"02said02Raskolnikov02irritably,02as02it02were02in02
spite02of02himself.0202
"Ah,02my02dear,02I02don't02know02what02to02talk02about,"02broke02
from02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna.0202
"Why,02are02you02all02afraid02of02me?"02he02asked,02with02a02
constrained02smile.0202
"That's02certainly02true,"02said02Dounia,02looking02directly02
and02sternly02at02her02brother.02"Mother02was02crossing02herself02
with02terror02as02she02came02up02the02stairs."0202
His02face02worked,02as02though02in02convulsion.0202
"Ach,02what02are02you02saying,02Dounia!02Don't02be02angry,02
please,02Rodya....02Why02did02you02say02that,02Dounia?"02Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna02began,02overwhelmed―"You02see,02coming02
here,02I02was02dreaming02all02the02way,02in02the02train,02how02we02
should02 meet,02 how02 we02 should02 talk02 over02 everything02
together....02And02I02was02so02happy,02I02did02not02notice02the02
journey!02But02what02am02I02saying?02I02am02happy02now....02You02
should02not,02Dounia....02I02am02happy02now―simply02in02seeing02
you,02Rodya...."0202
"Hush,02mother,"02he02muttered02in02confusion,02not02looking02
at02her,02but02pressing02her02hand.02"We02shall02have02time02to02speak02
freely02of02everything!"0202
As02he02said02this,02he02was02suddenly02overwhelmed02with02
confusion02and02turned02pale.02Again02that02awful02sensation02he02
had02known02of02late02passed02with02deadly02chill02over02his02soul.02
Again02it02became02suddenly02plain02and02perceptible02to02him02
that02he02had02just02told02a02fearful02lie―that02he02would02never02
now02be02able02to02speak02freely02of02everything―that02he02would02
never02again02be02able02to02 speak02of02anything02to02anyone.02The02
anguish02of02this02thought02was02such02that02for02a02moment02he02
almost02forgot02himself.02He02got02up02from02his02seat,02and02not02
looking02at02anyone02walked02towards02the02door.0202
"What02are02you02about?"02cried02Razumihin,02clutching02him02
by02the02arm.0202
He02sat02down02again,02and02began02looking02about02him,02in02
silence.02They02were02all02looking02at02him02in02perplexity.0202
"But02what02are02you02all02so02dull02for?"02he02shouted,02suddenly02
and02quite02unexpectedly.02"Do02say02something!02What's02the02
use02of02sitting02like02this?02Come,02do02speak.02Let02us02talk....02We02
meet02together02and02sit02in02silence....02Come,02anything!"0202
"Thank02God;02I02was02afraid02the02same02thing02as02yesterday02
was02 beginning02 again,"02 said02 Pulcheria02 Alexandrovna,02
crossing02herself.0202
"What02
the02 matter,02 Rodya?"02 asked02 Avdotya02
is02
Romanovna,02distrustfully.0202
"Oh,02nothing!02I02remembered02something,"02he02answered,02
and02suddenly02laughed.0202
"Well,02if02you02remembered02something;02that's02all02right!...02I02
was02beginning02to02think..."02muttered02Zossimov,02getting02up02
from02the02sofa.02"It02is02time02for02me02to02be02off.02I02will02look02in02
again02perhaps...02if02I02can..."02He02made02his02bows,02and02went02out.0202
"What02 an02 excellent02 man!"02 observed02 Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna.0202
"Yes,02excellent,02splendid,02well\educated,02intelligent,"02
Raskolnikov02began,02suddenly02speaking02with02surprising02
smiled02
rapidity,02and02a02liveliness02he02had02not02shown02till02then.02"I02
can't02remember02where02I02met02him02before02my02illness....02I02
believe02I02have02met02him02somewhere――...02And02this02is02a02
good02man,02too,"02he02nodded02at02Razumihin.02"Do02you02like02him,02
Dounia?"02he02asked02her;02and02suddenly,02for02some02unknown02
reason,02laughed.0202
"Very02much,"02answered02Dounia.0202
"Foo!―what02a02pig02you02are!"02Razumihin02protested,02
blushing02in02terrible02confusion,02and02he02got02up02from02his02
faintly,02 but02
chair.02 Pulcheria02 Alexandrovna02
Raskolnikov02laughed02aloud.0202
"Where02are02you02off02to?"0202
"I02must02go."0202
"You02need02not02at02all.02Stay.02Zossimov02has02gone,02so02you02
must.02Don't02go.02What's02the02time?02Is02it02twelve02o'clock?02What02
a02pretty02watch02you02have02got,02Dounia.02But02why02are02you02all02
silent02again?02I02do02all02the02talking."0202
"It02was02a02present02from02Marfa02Petrovna,"02answered02
Dounia.0202
"And02 a02 very02 expensive02 one!"02 added02 Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna.0202
"A\ah!02What02a02big02one!02Hardly02like02a02lady's."0202
"I02like02that02sort,"02said02Dounia.0202
"So02it02is02not02a02present02from02her02 fiancé,"02thought02
Razumihin,02and02was02unreasonably02delighted.0202
"I02
thought02
it02 was02 Luzhin's02 present,"02 observed02
Raskolnikov.0202
"No,02he02has02not02made02Dounia02any02presents02yet."0202
"A\ah!02And02do02you02remember,02mother,02I02was02in02love02and02
wanted02to02get02married?"02he02said02suddenly,02looking02at02his02
mother,02who02was02disconcerted02by02the02sudden02change02of02
subject02and02the02way02he02spoke02of02it.0202
"Oh,02yes,02my02dear."0202
Pulcheria02 Alexandrovna02 exchanged02 glances02 with02
Dounia02and02Razumihin.0202
"H'm,02yes.02What02shall02I02tell02you?02I02don't02remember02much02
indeed.02She02was02such02a02sickly02girl,"02he02went02on,02growing02
dreamy02and02looking02down02again.02"Quite02an02invalid.02She02
was02fond02of02giving02alms02to02the02poor,02and02was02always02
dreaming02of02a02nunnery,02and02once02she02burst02into02tears02
when02she02began02talking02to02me02about02it.02Yes,02yes,02I02
remember.02I02remember02very02well.02She02was02an02ugly02little02
thing.02I02really02don't02know02what02drew02me02to02her02then―I02
think02it02was02because02she02was02always02ill.02If02she02had02been02
lame02or02hunchback,02I02believe02I02should02have02liked02her02better02
still,"02he02smiled02dreamily.02"Yes,02it02was02a02sort02of02spring02
delirium."0202
"No,02it02was02not02only02spring02delirium,"02said02Dounia,02with02
warm02feeling.0202
He02fixed02a02strained02intent02look02on02his02sister,02but02did02not02
hear02or02did02not02understand02her02words.02Then,02completely02
lost02in02thought,02he02got02up,02went02up02to02his02mother,02kissed02
her,02went02back02to02his02place02and02sat02down.0202
"You02love02her02even02now?"02said02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna,02
touched.0202
"Her?02Now?02Oh,02yes....02You02ask02about02her?02No...02that's02all02
now,02as02it02were,02in02another02world...02and02so02long02ago.02And02
indeed02everything02happening02here02seems02somehow02far02
away."02He02looked02attentively02at02them.02"You,02now...02I02seem02
to02be02looking02at02you02from02a02thousand02miles02away...02but,02
goodness02knows02why02we02are02talking02of02that!02And02what's02
the02use02of02asking02about02it?"02he02added02with02annoyance,02and02
biting02his02nails,02fell02into02dreamy02silence02again.0202
"What02a02wretched02lodging02you02have,02Rodya!02It's02like02a02
tomb,"02said02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna,02suddenly02breaking02
the02oppressive02silence.02"I02am02sure02it's02quite02half02through02
your02lodging02you02have02become02so02melancholy."0202
"My02lodging,"02he02answered,02listlessly.02"Yes,02the02lodging02
had02a02great02deal02to02do02with02it....02I02thought02that,02too....02If02only02
you02knew,02though,02what02a02strange02thing02you02said02just02now,02
mother,"02he02said,02laughing02strangely.0202
A02little02more,02and02their02companionship,02this02mother02and02
this02sister,02with02him02after02three02years'02absence,02this02
intimate02tone02of02conversation,02in02face02of02the02utter02
impossibility02of02really02speaking02about02anything,02would02
have02been02beyond02his02power02of02endurance.02But02there02was02
one02urgent02matter02which02must02be02settled02one02way02or02the02
other02that02day―so02he02had02decided02when02he02woke.02Now02he02
was02glad02to02remember02it,02as02a02means02of02escape.0202
"Listen,02Dounia,"02he02began,02gravely02and02drily,02"of02course02
I02beg02your02pardon02for02yesterday,02but02I02consider02it02my02duty02
to02tell02you02again02that02I02do02not02withdraw02from02my02chief02
point.02It02is02me02or02Luzhin.02If02I02am02a02scoundrel,02you02must02not02
be.02One02is02enough.02If02you02marry02Luzhin,02I02cease02at02once02to02
look02on02you02as02a02sister."0202
"Rodya,02Rodya!02It02is02the02same02as02yesterday02again,"02
Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02cried,02mournfully.02"And02why02do02
you02call02yourself02a02scoundrel?02I02can't02bear02it.02You02said02the02
same02yesterday."0202
"Brother,"02Dounia02answered02firmly02and02with02the02same02
dryness.02"In02all02this02there02is02a02mistake02on02your02part.02I02
thought02it02over02at02night,02and02found02out02the02mistake.02It02is02all02
because02you02seem02to02fancy02I02am02sacrificing02myself02to02

being02useful02to02my02family.02But02that02is02not02the02chief02motive02
for02my02decision...."0202
"She02is02lying,"02he02thought02to02himself,02biting02his02nails02
vindictively.02"Proud02creature!02She02won't02admit02she02wants02
to02do02it02out02of02charity!02Too02haughty!02Oh,02base02characters!02
They02even02love02as02though02they02hate....02Oh,02how02I...02hate02
them02all!"0202
"In02fact,"02continued02Dounia,02"I02am02marrying02Pyotr02
Petrovitch02because02of02two02evils02I02choose02the02less.02I02intend02

him....02Why02did02you02smile02just02now?"02She,02too,02flushed,02and02
there02was02a02gleam02of02anger02in02her02eyes.0202
"All?"02he02asked,02with02a02malignant02grin.0202
"Within02certain02limits.02Both02the02manner02and02form02of02
Pyotr02Petrovitch's02courtship02showed02me02at02once02what02he02

hope02he02esteems02me,02too....02Why02are02you02laughing02again?"0202
"And02why02are02you02blushing02again?02You02are02lying,02sister.02
feminine02

can02blush02for02it."0202
"It02is02not02true.02I02am02not02lying,"02cried02Dounia,02losing02her02
composure.02"I02would02not02marry02him02if02I02were02not02

"Good02heavens!02You02have02made02him02faint,"02cried02
Pulcheria02Alexandrovna.0202
"No,02no,02nonsense!02It's02nothing.02A02little02giddiness―not02
fainting.02You02have02fainting02on02the02brain.02H'm,02yes,02what02

"Mother,02show02Rodya02Pyotr02Petrovitch's02letter,"02said02
Dounia.0202With02trembling02hands,02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02gave02
him02the02letter.02He02took02it02with02great02interest,02but,02before02
opening02it,02he02suddenly02looked02with02a02sort02of02wonder02at02
Dounia.0202
"It02is02strange,"02he02said,02slowly,02as02though02struck02by02a02
new02idea.02"What02am02I02making02such02a02fuss02for?02What02is02it02all02
about?02Marry02whom02you02like!"0202
He02said02this02as02though02to02himself,02but02said02it02aloud,02and02
looked02for02some02time02at02his02sister,02as02though02puzzled.02He02
opened02the02letter02at02last,02still02with02the02same02look02of02strange02
wonder02on02his02face.02Then,02slowly02and02attentively,02he02began02
reading,02
twice.02 Pulcheria02
it02
through02
Alexandrovna02showed02marked02anxiety,02and02all02indeed02
expected02something02particular.0202
"What02surprises02me,"02he02began,02after02a02short02pause,02
handing02the02letter02to02his02mother,02but02not02addressing02
anyone02in02particular,02"is02that02he02is02a02business02man,02a02

They02all02started.02They02had02expected02something02quite02
different.0202
read02
and02
"But02they02all02write02like02that,02you02know,"02Razumihin02
observed,02abruptly.0202
"Have02you02read02it?"0202
"Yes."0202
"We02showed02him,02Rodya.02We...02consulted02him02just02now,"02
Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02began,02embarrassed.0202
"That's02just02the02jargon02of02the02courts,"02Razumihin02put02in.02
"Legal02documents02are02written02like02that02to02this02day."0202
"Legal?02Yes,02it's02just02legal―business02language―not02so02
very02 uneducated,02 and02 not02 quite02 educated―business02
language!"0202
"Pyotr02Petrovitch02makes02no02secret02of02the02fact02that02he02
had02a02cheap02education,02he02is02proud02indeed02of02having02made02

"Well,02if02he's02proud02of02it,02he02has02reason,02I02don't02deny02it.02

Dounia02did02not02reply.02Her02resolution02had02been02taken.02
She02was02only02awaiting02the02evening.0202
"Then02what02is02your02decision,02Rodya?"02asked02Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna,02who02was02more02uneasy02than02ever02at02the02

"What02decision?"0202
"You02see02Pyotr02Petrovitch02writes02that02you02are02not02to02be02

"Dounia02has02already02decided,02and02I02fully02agree02with02
her,"02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02hastened02to02declare.0202
"I02decided02to02ask02you,02Rodya,02to02urge02you02not02to02fail02to02

"Yes."0202
"I02will02ask02you,02too,02to02be02with02us02at02eight02o'clock,"02she02

0202
At02that02moment02the02door02was02softly02opened,02and02a02
young02girl02walked02into02the02room,02looking02timidly02about02
her.02Everyone02turned02towards02her02with02surprise02and02
curiosity.02At02first02sight,02Raskolnikov02did02not02recognise02her.02
It02was02Sofya02Semyonovna02Marmeladov.02He02had02seen02her02
yesterday02for02the02first02time,02but02at02such02a02moment,02in02such02
surroundings02and02in02such02a02dress,02that02his02memory02
retained02a02very02different02image02of02her.02Now02she02was02a02
modestly02and02poorly\dressed02young02girl,02very02young,02
indeed,02almost02like02a02child,02with02a02modest02and02refined02

as02
face.02She02was02wearing02a02very02plain02indoor02dress,02and02had02
on02a02shabby02old\fashioned02hat,02but02she02still02carried02a02
parasol.02Unexpectedly02finding02the02room02full02of02people,02she02
was02 not02
completely02
so02 much02
embarrassed02
overwhelmed02with02shyness,02like02a02little02child.02She02was02even02
it's02 you!"02 said02 Raskolnikov,02
about02 to02 retreat.02 "Oh...02
extremely02astonished,02and02he,02too,02was02confused.02He02at02
once02recollected02that02his02mother02and02sister02knew02through02
Luzhin's02letter02of02"some02young02woman02of02notorious02
behaviour."02He02had02only02just02been02protesting02against02
Luzhin's02calumny02and02declaring02that02he02had02seen02the02girl02
last02night02for02the02first02time,02and02suddenly02she02had02walked02
in.02He02remembered,02too,02that02he02had02not02protested02against02
the02expression02"of02notorious02behaviour."02All02this02passed02
vaguely02and02fleetingly02through02his02brain,02but02looking02at02her02
more02intently,02he02saw02that02the02humiliated02creature02was02so02
humiliated02that02he02felt02suddenly02sorry02for02her.02When02she02
made02a02movement02to02retreat02in02terror,02it02sent02a02pang02to02his02
heart.0202
"I02did02not02expect02you,"02he02said,02hurriedly,02with02a02look02
that02made02her02stop.02"Please02sit02down.02You02come,02no02doubt,02
from02Katerina02Ivanovna.02Allow02me―not02there.02Sit02here...."0202
At02Sonia's02entrance,02Razumihin,02who02had02been02sitting02
on02one02of02Raskolnikov's02three02chairs,02close02to02the02door,02got02
up02to02allow02her02to02enter.02Raskolnikov02had02at02first02shown02
her02the02place02on02the02sofa02where02Zossimov02had02been02sitting,02
but02feeling02that02the02sofa02which02served02him02as02a02bed,02was02
too02 familiar02a02place,02he02hurriedly02motioned02her02to02
Razumihin's02chair.0202
"You02sit02here,"02he02said02to02Razumihin,02putting02him02on02the02
sofa.0202Sonia02sat02down,02almost02shaking02with02terror,02and02looked02
timidly02at02 the02two02
ladies.02It02was02evidently02almost02
inconceivable02to02herself02that02she02could02sit02down02beside02
them.02At02the02thought02of02it,02she02was02so02frightened02that02she02
hurriedly02got02up02again,02and02in02utter02confusion02addressed02
Raskolnikov.0202
"I...02I...02have02come02for02one02minute.02Forgive02me02for02
disturbing02you,"02she02began02falteringly.02"I02come02from02
Katerina02Ivanovna,02and02she02had02no02one02to02send.02Katerina02
Ivanovna02told02me02to02beg02you...02to02be02at02the02service...02in02the02

do02her02the02honour...02she02told02me02to02beg02you..."02Sonia02
stammered02and02ceased02speaking.0202
"I02 will02 try,02 certainly,02 most02 certainly,"02 answered02
Raskolnikov.02He,02too,02stood02up,02and02he,02too,02faltered02and02
could02not02finish02his02sentence.02"Please02sit02down,"02he02said,02
suddenly.02"I02want02to02talk02to02you.02You02are02perhaps02in02a02
hurry,02but02please,02be02so02kind,02spare02me02two02minutes,"02and02
he02drew02up02a02chair02for02her.0202
Sonia02sat02down02again,02and02again02timidly02she02took02a02
hurried,02frightened02look02at02the02two02ladies,02and02dropped02her02
eyes.02Raskolnikov's02pale02face02flushed,02a02shudder02passed02
over02him,02his02eyes02glowed.0202
"Mother,"02he02said,02firmly02and02insistently,02"this02is02Sofya02
Semyonovna02 Marmeladov,02
that02
the02 daughter02 of02
unfortunate02Mr.02Marmeladov,02who02was02run02over02yesterday02
before02my02eyes,02and02of02whom02I02was02just02telling02you."0202
Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02glanced02at02Sonia,02and02slightly02
screwed02up02her02eyes.02In02spite02of02her02embarrassment02before02
Rodya's02urgent02and02challenging02look,02she02could02not02deny02
herself02that02satisfaction.02Dounia02gazed02gravely02and02intently02
into02the02poor02girl's02face,02and02scrutinised02her02with02
perplexity.02Sonia,02hearing02herself02introduced,02tried02to02raise02
her02eyes02again,02but02was02more02embarrassed02than02ever.0202
"I02wanted02to02ask02you,"02said02Raskolnikov,02hastily,02"how02
things02were02arranged02yesterday.02You02were02not02worried02by02
the02police,02for02instance?"0202
"No,02that02was02all02right...02it02was02too02evident,02the02cause02of02
death...02they02did02not02worry02us...02only02the02lodgers02are02angry."0202
"Why?"0202
"At02the02body's02remaining02so02long.02You02see02it02is02hot02now.02
So02that,02to\day,02they02will02carry02it02to02the02cemetery,02into02the02
chapel,02until02to\morrow.02At02first02Katerina02Ivanovna02was02
unwilling,02but02now02she02sees02herself02that02it's02necessary..."0202
"To\day,02then?"0202
"She02begs02you02to02do02us02the02honour02to02be02in02the02church02
to\morrow02for02the02service,02and02then02to02be02present02at02the02
funeral02lunch."0202
"She02is02giving02a02funeral02lunch?"0202
"Yes...02just02a02little....02She02told02me02to02thank02you02very02much02
for02helping02us02yesterday.02But02for02you,02we02should02have02had02
nothing02for02the02funeral."0202
All02at02once02her02lips02and02chin02began02trembling,02but,02with02
an02effort,02she02controlled02herself,02looking02down02again.0202
During02the02conversation,02Raskolnikov02watched02her02
carefully.02She02had02a02thin,02very02thin,02pale02little02face,02rather02
irregular02and02angular,02with02a02sharp02little02nose02and02chin.02
She02could02not02have02been02called02pretty,02but02her02blue02eyes02
were02so02clear,02and02when02they02lighted02up,02there02was02such02a02
kindliness02and02simplicity02in02her02expression02that02one02could02
not02help02being02attracted.02Her02face,02and02her02whole02figure02
indeed,02had02another02peculiar02characteristic.02In02spite02of02her02
eighteen02years,02she02looked02almost02a02little02girl―almost02a02
child.02And02in02some02of02her02gestures,02this02childishness02
seemed02almost02absurd.0202
"But02has02Katerina02Ivanovna02been02able02to02manage02with02
such02small02means?02Does02she02even02mean02to02have02a02funeral02
lunch?"02Raskolnikov02asked,02persistently02keeping02up02the02
conversation.0202
"The02coffin02will02be02plain,02of02course...02and02everything02will02
be02plain,02so02it02won't02cost02much.02Katerina02Ivanovna02and02I02
have02reckoned02it02all02out,02so02that02there02will02be02enough02left...02
and02Katerina02Ivanovna02was02very02anxious02it02should02be02so.02
You02know02one02can't...02it's02a02comfort02to02her...02she02is02like02that,02
you02know...."0202
"I02understand,02I02understand...02of02course...02why02do02you02
look02at02my02room02like02that?02My02mother02has02just02said02it02is02
like02a02tomb."0202
"You02 gave02 us02 everything02 yesterday,"02 Sonia02 said02
suddenly,02in02reply,02in02a02loud02rapid02whisper;02and02again02she02
looked02down02in02confusion.02Her02lips02and02chin02were02
trembling02once02more.02She02had02been02struck02at02once02by02
Raskolnikov's02poor02surroundings,02and02now02these02words02
broke02out02spontaneously.02A02silence02followed.02There02was02a02
light02in02Dounia's02eyes,02and02even02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02
looked02kindly02at02Sonia.0202
"Rodya,"02she02said,02getting02up,02"we02shall02have02dinner02
together,02of02course.02Come,02Dounia....02And02you,02Rodya,02had02
better02go02for02a02little02walk,02and02then02rest02and02lie02down02
before02you02come02to02see02us....02I02am02afraid02we02have02exhausted02
you...."0202
"Yes,02yes,02I'll02come,"02he02answered,02getting02up02fussily.02
"But02I02have02something02to02see02to."0202
"But02surely02you02will02have02dinner02together?"02cried02
Razumihin,02looking02in02surprise02at02Raskolnikov.02"What02do02
you02mean?"0202
"Yes,02yes,02I02am02coming...02of02course,02of02course!02And02you02
stay02a02minute.02You02do02not02want02him02just02now,02do02you,02
mother?02Or02perhaps02I02am02taking02him02from02you?"0202
"Oh,02no,02no.02And02will02you,02Dmitri02Prokofitch,02do02us02the02
favour02of02dining02with02us?"0202
"Please02do,"02added02Dounia.0202
Razumihin02bowed,02positively02radiant.02For02one02moment,02
they02were02all02strangely02embarrassed.0202
"Good\bye,02Rodya,02that02is02till02we02meet.02I02do02not02like02
saying02good\bye.02Good\bye,02Nastasya.02Ah,02I02have02said02good\
bye02again."0202
Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02meant02to02greet02Sonia,02too;02but02
it02somehow02failed02to02come02off,02and02she02went02in02a02flutter02out02
of02the02room.0202
But02Avdotya02Romanovna02seemed02to02await02her02turn,02and02
following02her02mother02out,02gave02Sonia02an02attentive,02
courteous02bow.02Sonia,02in02confusion,02gave02a02hurried,02
frightened02curtsy.02There02was02a02look02of02poignant02discomfort02
in02her02face,02as02though02Avdotya02Romanovna's02courtesy02and02
attention02were02oppressive02and02painful02to02her.0202
"Dounia,02good\bye,"02called02Raskolnikov,02in02the02passage.02
"Give02me02your02hand."0202
"Why,02I02did02give02it02to02you.02Have02you02forgotten?"02said02
Dounia,02turning02warmly02and02awkwardly02to02him.0202
"Never02mind,02give02it02to02me02again."02And02he02squeezed02her02
fingers02warmly.0202
Dounia02smiled,02flushed,02pulled02her02hand02away,02and02
went02off02quite02happy.0202
"Come,02that's02capital,"02he02said02to02Sonia,02going02back02and02
looking02brightly02at02her.02"God02give02peace02to02the02dead,02the02
living02have02still02to02live.02That02is02right,02isn't02it?"0202
Sonia02looked02surprised02at02the02sudden02brightness02of02his02
face.02He02looked02at02her02for02some02moments02in02silence.02The02
whole02history02of02the02dead02father02floated02before02his02
memory02in02those02moments....0202
02
"Heavens,02Dounia,"02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02began,02as02
soon02as02they02were02in02the02street,02"I02really02feel02relieved02
myself02at02coming02away―more02at02ease.02How02little02did02I02
think02yesterday02in02the02train02that02I02could02ever02be02glad02of02
that."0202
"I02tell02you02again,02mother,02he02is02still02very02ill.02Don't02you02
see02it?02Perhaps02worrying02about02us02upset02him.02We02must02be02
patient,02and02much,02much02can02be02forgiven."0202
"Well,02 you02 were02 not02 very02 patient!"02 Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna02caught02her02up,02hotly02and02jealously.02"Do02you02
know,02Dounia,02I02was02looking02at02you02two.02You02are02the02very02
portrait02of02him,02and02not02so02much02in02face02as02in02soul.02You02are02
both02melancholy,02both02morose02and02hot\tempered,02both02
haughty02and02both02generous....02Surely02he02can't02be02an02egoist,02
Dounia.02Eh?02When02I02think02of02what02is02in02store02for02us02this02
evening,02my02heart02sinks!"0202
"Don't02be02uneasy,02mother.02What02must02be,02will02be."0202
"Dounia,02only02think02what02a02position02we02are02in!02What02if02
Pyotr02 Petrovitch02 breaks02
it02 off?"02 poor02 Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna02blurted02out,02incautiously.0202
"He02won't02be02worth02much02if02he02does,"02answered02Dounia,02
sharply02and02contemptuously.0202
"We02did02well02to02come02away,"02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02
hurriedly02broke02in.02"He02was02in02a02hurry02about02some02
business02or02other.02If02he02gets02out02and02has02a02breath02of02air...02it02
is02fearfully02close02in02his02room....02But02where02is02one02to02get02a02
breath02of02air02here?02The02very02streets02here02feel02like02shut\up02
rooms.02Good02heavens!02what02a02town!...02stay...02this02side...02they02
will02crush02you―carrying02something.02Why,02it02is02a02piano02
they02have02got,02I02declare...02how02they02push!...02I02am02very02much02
afraid02of02that02young02woman,02too."0202
"What02young02woman,02mother?0202
"Why,02that02Sofya02Semyonovna,02who02was02there02just02
now."0202
"Why?"0202
"I02have02a02presentiment,02Dounia.02Well,02you02may02believe02it02
or02not,02but02as02soon02as02she02came02in,02that02very02minute,02I02felt02
that02she02was02the02chief02cause02of02the02trouble...."0202
"Nothing02of02the02sort!"02cried02Dounia,02in02vexation.02"What02
nonsense,02with02your02presentiments,02mother!02He02only02made02
her02acquaintance02the02evening02before,02and02he02did02not02know02
her02when02she02came02in."0202
"Well,02you02will02see....02She02worries02me;02but02you02will02see,02
you02will02see!02I02was02so02frightened.02She02was02gazing02at02me02
with02those02eyes.02I02could02scarcely02sit02still02in02my02chair02when02
he02began02introducing02her,02do02you02remember?02It02seems02so02
strange,02but02Pyotr02Petrovitch02writes02like02that02about02her,02
and02he02introduces02her02to02us―to02you!02So02he02must02think02a02
great02deal02of02her."0202
"People02will02write02anything.02We02were02talked02about02and02
written02about,02too.02Have02you02forgotten?02I02am02sure02that02she02
is02a02good02girl,02and02that02it02is02all02nonsense."0202
"God02grant02it02may02be!"0202
"And02Pyotr02Petrovitch02is02a02contemptible02slanderer,"02
Dounia02snapped02out,02suddenly.0202
Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02was02crushed;02the02conversation02
was02not02resumed.0202
"I02will02tell02you02what02I02want02with02you,"02said02Raskolnikov,02
drawing02Razumihin02to02the02window.0202
02
"Then02I02will02tell02Katerina02Ivanovna02that02you02are02
coming,"02Sonia02said02hurriedly,02preparing02to02depart.0202
"One02minute,02Sofya02Semyonovna.02We02have02no02secrets.02
You02are02not02in02our02way.02I02want02to02have02another02word02or02
two02with02you.02Listen!"02he02turned02suddenly02to02Razumihin02
again.02 "You02 know02 that...02 what's02 his02 name...02 Porfiry02
Petrovitch?"0202
"I02should02think02so!02He02is02a02relation.02Why?"02added02the02
latter,02with02interest.0202
"Is02not02he02managing02that02case...02you02know,02about02that02
murder?...02You02were02speaking02about02it02yesterday."0202
"Yes...02well?"02Razumihin's02eyes02opened02wide.0202
"He02was02inquiring02for02people02who02had02pawned02things,02
and02I02have02some02pledges02there,02too―trifles―a02ring02my02
sister02gave02me02as02a02keepsake02when02I02left02home,02and02my02
father's02silver02watch―they02are02only02worth02five02or02six02
roubles02altogether...02but02I02value02them.02So02what02am02I02to02do02
now?02I02do02not02want02to02lose02the02things,02especially02the02watch.02
I02was02quaking02just02now,02for02fear02mother02would02ask02to02look02
at02it,02when02we02spoke02of02Dounia's02watch.02It02is02the02only02thing02
of02father's02left02us.02She02would02be02ill02if02it02were02lost.02You02know02
what02women02are.02So02tell02me02what02to02do.02I02know02I02ought02to02
have02given02notice02at02the02police02station,02but02would02it02not02be02
better02to02go02straight02to02Porfiry?02Eh?02What02do02you02think?02
The02matter02might02be02settled02more02quickly.02You02see,02mother02
may02ask02for02it02before02dinner."0202
"Certainly02not02to02the02police02station.02Certainly02to02
Porfiry,"02Razumihin02shouted02in02extraordinary02excitement.02
"Well,02how02glad02I02am.02Let02us02go02at02once.02It02is02a02couple02of02
steps.02We02shall02be02sure02to02find02him."0202
"Very02well,02let02us02go."0202
"And02he02will02be02very,02very02glad02to02make02your02
acquaintance.02I02have02often02talked02to02him02of02you02at02different02
times.02I02was02speaking02of02you02yesterday.02Let02us02go.02So02you02
knew02the02old02woman?02So02that's02it!02It02is02all02turning02out02
splendidly....02Oh,02yes,02Sofya02Ivanovna..."0202
"Sofya02Semyonovna,"02corrected02Raskolnikov.02"Sofya02
Semyonovna,02this02is02my02friend02Razumihin,02and02he02is02a02good02
man."0202
"If02you02have02to02go02now,"02Sonia02was02beginning,02not02
looking02at02Razumihin02at02all,02and02still02more02embarrassed.0202
"Let02us02go,"02decided02Raskolnikov.02"I02will02come02to02you02to\
day,02Sofya02Semyonovna.02Only02tell02me02where02you02live."0202
He02was02not02exactly02ill02at02ease,02but02seemed02hurried,02and02
avoided02her02eyes.02Sonia02gave02her02address,02and02flushed02as02
she02did02so.02They02all02went02out02together.0202
"Don't02you02lock02up?"02asked02Razumihin,02following02him02
on02to02the02stairs.0202
"Never,"02answered02Raskolnikov.02"I02have02been02meaning02
to02buy02a02lock02for02these02two02years.02People02are02happy02who02
have02no02need02of02locks,"02he02said,02laughing,02to02Sonia.02They02
stood02still02in02the02gateway.0202
"Do02you02go02to02the02right,02Sofya02Semyonovna?02How02did02
you02find02me,02by02the02way?"02he02added,02as02though02he02wanted02
to02say02something02quite02different.02He02wanted02to02look02at02her02
soft02clear02eyes,02but02this02was02not02easy.0202
"Why,02you02gave02your02address02to02Polenka02yesterday."0202
"Polenka?02Oh,02yes;02Polenka,02that02is02the02little02girl.02She02is02
your02sister?02Did02I02give02her02the02address?"0202
"Why,02had02you02forgotten?"0202
"No,02I02remember."0202
"I02had02heard02my02father02speak02of02you...02only02I02did02not02
know02your02name,02and02he02did02not02know02it.02And02now02I02
came...02and02as02I02had02learnt02your02name,02I02asked02to\day,02
'Where02does02Mr.02Raskolnikov02live?'02I02did02not02know02you02had02
only02a02room02too....02Good\bye,02I02will02tell02Katerina02Ivanovna."0202
She02was02extremely02glad02to02escape02at02last;02she02went02
away02looking02down,02hurrying02to02get02out02of02sight02as02soon02as02
possible,02to02walk02the02twenty02steps02to02the02turning02on02the02
right02and02to02be02at02last02alone,02and02then02moving02rapidly02
along,02looking02at02no02one,02noticing02nothing,02to02think,02to02
remember,02to02meditate02on02every02word,02every02detail.02Never,02
never02 had02 she02
like02 this.02 Dimly02 and02
felt02 anything02
unconsciously02a02whole02new02world02was02opening02before02her.02
She02remembered02suddenly02that02Raskolnikov02meant02to02
come02to02her02that02day,02perhaps02at02once!0202
"Only02 not02 to\day,02 please,02 not02 to\day!"02 she02 kept02
muttering02with02a02sinking02heart,02as02though02entreating02
someone,02like02a02frightened02child.02"Mercy!02to02me...02to02that02
room...02he02will02see...02oh,02dear!"0202
She02was02not02capable02at02that02instant02of02noticing02an02
unknown02gentleman02who02was02watching02her02and02following02
at02her02heels.02He02had02accompanied02her02from02the02gateway.02At02
the02moment02when02Razumihin,02Raskolnikov,02and02she02stood02
still02at02parting02on02the02pavement,02this02gentleman,02who02was02
just02passing,02started02on02hearing02Sonia's02words:02"and02I02
asked02where02Mr.02Raskolnikov02lived?"02He02turned02a02rapid02
but02 attentive02
look02 upon02 all02 three,02 especially02 upon02
Raskolnikov,02to02whom02Sonia02was02speaking;02then02looked02
back02and02noted02the02house.02All02this02was02done02in02an02instant02
as02he02passed,02and02trying02not02to02betray02his02interest,02he02
walked02on02more02slowly02as02though02waiting02for02something.02
He02was02waiting02for02Sonia;02he02saw02that02they02were02parting,02
and02that02Sonia02was02going02home.0202
"Home?02Where?02I've02seen02that02face02somewhere,"02he02
thought.02"I02must02find02out."0202
At02the02turning02he02crossed02over,02looked02round,02and02saw02
Sonia02coming02the02same02way,02noticing02nothing.02She02turned02
the02corner.02He02followed02her02on02the02other02side.02After02about02
fifty02paces02he02crossed02over02again,02overtook02her02and02kept02
two02or02three02yards02behind02her.0202
He02was02a02man02about02fifty,02rather02tall02and02thickly02set,02
with02broad02high02shoulders02which02made02him02look02as02though02
he02stooped02a02little.02He02wore02good02and02fashionable02clothes,02
and02looked02like02a02gentleman02of02position.02He02carried02a02
handsome02cane,02which02he02tapped02on02the02pavement02at02each02
step;02his02gloves02were02spotless.02He02had02a02broad,02rather02
pleasant02face02with02high02cheek\bones02and02a02fresh02colour,02
not02often02seen02in02Petersburg.02His02flaxen02hair02was02still02
abundant,02and02only02touched02here02and02there02with02grey,02and02
his02thick02square02beard02was02even02lighter02than02his02hair.02His02
eyes02were02blue02and02had02a02cold02and02thoughtful02look;02his02lips02
were02crimson.02He02was02a02remarkedly02well\preserved02man02
and02looked02much02younger02than02his02years.0202
When02Sonia02came02out02on02the02canal02bank,02they02were02the02
only02two02persons02on02the02pavement.02He02observed02her02
dreaminess02and02preoccupation.02On02reaching02the02house02
where02she02lodged,02Sonia02turned02in02at02the02gate;02he02followed02
her,02seeming02rather02surprised.02In02the02courtyard02she02turned02
to02 the02 right02 corner.02 "Bah!"02 muttered02 the02 unknown02
gentleman,02and02mounted02the02stairs02behind02her.02Only02then02
Sonia02noticed02him.02She02reached02the02third02storey,02turned02
down02the02passage,02and02rang02at02No.029.02On02the02door02was02
inscribed02in02chalk,02"Kapernaumov,02Tailor."02"Bah!"02the02
stranger02 repeated02 again,02 wondering02 at02 the02 strange02
coincidence,02and02he02rang02next02door,02at02No.028.02The02doors02
were02two02or02three02yards02apart.0202
"You02lodge02at02Kapernaumov's,"02he02said,02looking02at02Sonia02
and02laughing.02"He02altered02a02waistcoat02for02me02yesterday.02I02
am02staying02close02here02at02Madame02Resslich's.02How02odd!"02
Sonia02looked02at02him02attentively.0202
02
"We02are02neighbours,"02he02went02on02gaily.02"I02only02came02to02
town02the02day02before02yesterday.02Good\bye02for02the02present."0202
Sonia02made02no02reply;02the02door02opened02and02she02slipped02
in.02She02felt02for02some02reason02ashamed02and02uneasy.0202
On02the02way02to02Porfiry's,02Razumihin02was02obviously02
excited.0202
"That's02capital,02brother,"02he02repeated02several02times,02
"and02I02am02glad!02I02am02glad!"0202
"What02are02you02glad02about?"02Raskolnikov02thought02to02
himself.0202
"I02didn't02know02that02you02pledged02things02at02the02old02
woman's,02too.02And...02was02it02long02ago?02I02mean,02was02it02long02
since02you02were02there?"0202
"What02a02simple\hearted02fool02he02is!"0202
"When02was02it?"02Raskolnikov02stopped02still02to02recollect.02
"Two02or02three02days02before02her02death02it02must02have02been.02
But02I02am02not02going02to02redeem02the02things02now,"02he02put02in02
with02a02sort02of02hurried02and02conspicuous02solicitude02about02
the02things.02"I've02not02more02than02a02silver02rouble02left...02after02
last02night's02accursed02delirium!"0202
He02laid02special02emphasis02on02the02delirium.0202
"Yes,02yes,"02Razumihin02hastened02to02agree―with02what02
was02not02clear.02"Then02that's02why02you...02were02stuck...02partly...02
you02 know02
in02 your02 delirium02 you02 were02 continually02
mentioning02some02rings02or02chains!02Yes,02yes...02that's02clear,02it's02
all02clear02now."0202
"Hullo!02How02that02idea02must02have02got02about02among02
them.02Here02this02man02will02go02to02the02stake02for02me,02and02I02find02
him02delighted02at02having02it02cleared02up02why02I02spoke02of02rings02
in02my02delirium!02What02a02hold02the02idea02must02have02on02all02of02
them!"0202
"Shall02we02find02him?"02he02asked02suddenly.0202
"Oh,02yes,"02Razumihin02answered02quickly.02"He02is02a02nice02
fellow,02you02will02see,02brother.02Rather02clumsy,02that02is02to02say,02
he02is02a02man02of02polished02manners,02but02I02mean02clumsy02in02a02
different02sense.02He02is02an02intelligent02fellow,02very02much02so02
indeed,02but02he02has02his02own02range02of02ideas....02He02is02
incredulous,02sceptical,02cynical...02he02likes02to02impose02on02
people,02or02rather02to02make02fun02of02them.02His02is02the02old,02
circumstantial02method....02But02he02understands02his02work...02
thoroughly....02Last02year02he02cleared02up02a02case02of02murder02in02
which02the02police02had02hardly02a02clue.02He02is02very,02very02anxious02
to02make02your02acquaintance!"0202
"On02what02grounds02is02he02so02anxious?"0202
"Oh,02it's02not02exactly...02you02see,02since02you've02been02ill02I02
happen02to02have02mentioned02you02several02times....02So,02when02
he02heard02about02you...02about02your02being02a02law02student02and02
not02able02to02finish02your02studies,02he02said,02'What02a02pity!'02And02
so02I02concluded...02from02everything02together,02not02only02that;02
yesterday02Zametov...02you02know,02Rodya,02I02talked02some02
nonsense02on02the02way02home02to02you02yesterday,02when02I02was02
drunk...02I02am02afraid,02brother,02of02your02exaggerating02it,02you02
see."0202"What?02That02they02think02I02am02a02madman?02Maybe02they02
are02right,"02he02said02with02a02constrained02smile.0202
"Yes,02yes....02That02is,02pooh,02no!...02But02all02that02I02said02(and02
there02was02something02else02too)02it02was02all02nonsense,02
drunken02nonsense."0202
"But02why02are02you02apologising?02I02am02so02sick02of02it02all!"02
Raskolnikov02cried02with02exaggerated02irritability.02It02was02
partly02assumed,02however.0202
I02 know,02
"I02 know,02
I02 understand.02 Believe02 me,02
I02
understand.02One's02ashamed02to02speak02of02it."0202
"If02you02are02ashamed,02then02don't02speak02of02it."0202
Both02were02silent.02Razumihin02was02more02than02ecstatic02
and02Raskolnikov02perceived02it02with02repulsion.02He02was02
alarmed,02too,02by02what02Razumihin02had02just02said02about02
Porfiry.0202
"I02shall02have02to02pull02a02long02face02with02him02too,"02he02
thought,02with02a02beating02heart,02and02he02turned02white,02"and02
do02it02naturally,02too.02But02the02most02natural02thing02would02be02to02
do02nothing02at02all.02Carefully02do02nothing02at02all!02No,02carefully02
would02not02be02natural02again....02Oh,02well,02we02shall02see02how02it02
turns02out....02We02shall02see...02directly.02Is02it02a02good02thing02to02go02
or02not?02The02butterfly02flies02to02the02light.02My02heart02is02beating,02
that's02what's02bad!"0202
"In02this02grey02house,"02said02Razumihin.0202
"The02most02important02thing,02does02Porfiry02know02that02I02
was02at02the02old02hag's02flat02yesterday...02and02asked02about02the02
blood?02I02must02find02that02out02instantly,02as02soon02as02I02go02in,02find02
out02from02his02face;02otherwise...02I'll02find02out,02if02it's02my02ruin."0202
"I02 say,02 brother,"02 he02 said02 suddenly,02 addressing02
Razumihin,02with02a02sly02smile,02"I02have02been02noticing02all02day02
that02you02seem02to02be02curiously02excited.02Isn't02it02so?"0202
"Excited?02Not02a02bit02of02it,"02said02Razumihin,02stung02to02the02
quick.0202
"Yes,02brother,02I02assure02you02it's02noticeable.02Why,02you02sat02
on02your02chair02in02a02way02you02never02do02sit,02on02the02edge02
somehow,02and02you02seemed02to02be02writhing02all02the02time.02You02
kept02jumping02up02for02nothing.02One02moment02you02were02angry,02
and02the02next02your02face02looked02like02a02sweetmeat.02You02even02
blushed;02especially02when02you02were02invited02to02dinner,02you02
blushed02awfully."0202
"Nothing02of02the02sort,02nonsense!02What02do02you02mean?"0202
"But02why02are02you02wriggling02out02of02it,02like02a02schoolboy?02
By02Jove,02there02he's02blushing02again."0202
"What02a02pig02you02are!"0202
"But02why02are02you02so02shamefaced02about02it?02Romeo!02Stay,02
I'll02tell02of02you02to\day.02Ha\ha\ha!02I'll02make02mother02laugh,02and02
someone02else,02too..."0202
"Listen,02listen,02listen,02this02is02serious....02What02next,02you02
fiend!"02Razumihin02was02utterly02overwhelmed,02turning02cold02
with02horror.02"What02will02you02tell02them?02Come,02brother...02foo!02
what02a02pig02you02are!"0202
"You02are02like02a02summer02rose.02And02if02only02you02knew02how02
it02suits02you;02a02Romeo02over02six02foot02high!02And02how02you've02
washed02to\day―you02cleaned02your02nails,02I02declare.02Eh?02
That's02something02unheard02of!02Why,02I02do02believe02you've02got02
pomatum02on02your02hair!02Bend02down."0202
"Pig!"0202
Raskolnikov02laughed02as02though02he02could02not02restrain02
himself.02So02laughing,02they02entered02Porfiry02Petrovitch's02flat.02
This02is02what02Raskolnikov02wanted:02from02within02they02could02
be02heard02laughing02as02they02came02in,02still02guffawing02in02the02
passage.0202
"Not02a02word02here02or02I'll...02brain02you!"02Razumihin02
whispered02furiously,02seizing02Raskolnikov02by02the02shoulder.0202

CHAPTER02V0202
Raskolnikov02was02already02entering02the02room.02He02came02in02
looking02as02though02he02had02the02utmost02difficulty02not02to02burst02
out02laughing02again.02Behind02him02Razumihin02strode02in02
gawky02and02awkward,02shamefaced02and02red02as02a02peony,02with02
an02utterly02crestfallen02and02ferocious02expression.02His02face02
and02whole02figure02really02were02ridiculous02at02that02moment02
and02amply02justified02Raskolnikov's02laughter.02Raskolnikov,02
not02 waiting02 for02 an02
introduction,02 bowed02 to02 Porfiry02
Petrovitch,02who02stood02in02the02middle02of02the02room02looking02
inquiringly02at02them.02He02held02out02his02hand02and02shook02hands,02
still02apparently02making02desperate02efforts02to02subdue02his02
mirth02and02utter02a02few02words02to02introduce02himself.02But02he02
had02no02sooner02succeeded02in02assuming02a02serious02air02and02
muttering02something02when02he02suddenly02glanced02again02as02
though02accidentally02at02Razumihin,02and02could02no02longer02
control02himself:02his02stifled02laughter02broke02out02the02more02
irresistibly02 the02 more02 he02 tried02 to02 restrain02
it.02 The02
extraordinary02ferocity02with02which02Razumihin02received02this02
"spontaneous"02mirth02gave02the02whole02scene02the02appearance02
of02 most02 genuine02
fun02 and02 naturalness.02 Razumihin02
strengthened02this02impression02as02though02on02purpose.0202
"Fool!02You02fiend,"02he02roared,02waving02his02arm02which02at02
once02struck02a02little02round02table02with02an02empty02tea\glass02on02
it.02Everything02was02sent02flying02and02crashing.0202
"But02why02break02chairs,02gentlemen?02You02know02it's02a02loss02
to02the02Crown,"02Porfiry02Petrovitch02quoted02gaily.0202
Raskolnikov02was02still02laughing,02with02his02hand02in02Porfiry02
Petrovitch's,02but02anxious02not02to02overdo02it,02awaited02the02
right02moment02to02put02a02natural02end02to02it.02Razumihin,02
completely02put02to02confusion02by02upsetting02the02table02and02
smashing02the02glass,02gazed02gloomily02at02the02fragments,02
cursed02and02turned02sharply02to02the02window02where02he02stood02
looking02out02with02his02back02to02the02company02with02a02fiercely02
scowling02countenance,02seeing02nothing.02Porfiry02Petrovitch02
laughed02and02was02ready02to02go02on02laughing,02but02obviously02
looked02for02explanations.02Zametov02had02been02sitting02in02the02
corner,02but02he02rose02at02the02visitors'02entrance02and02was02
standing02in02expectation02with02a02smile02on02his02lips,02though02he02
looked02with02surprise02and02even02it02seemed02incredulity02at02the02
whole02 scene02 and02 at02 Raskolnikov02 with02 a02 certain02
embarrassment.02Zametov's02unexpected02presence02struck02
Raskolnikov02unpleasantly.0202
"I've02got02to02think02of02that,"02he02thought.02"Excuse02me,02
please,"02he02began,02affecting02extreme02embarrassment.02
"Raskolnikov."0202
"Not02at02all,02very02pleasant02to02see02you...02and02how02
pleasantly02you've02come02in....02Why,02won't02he02even02say02good\
morning?"02Porfiry02Petrovitch02nodded02at02Razumihin.0202
"Upon02my02honour02I02don't02know02why02he02is02in02such02a02rage02
with02me.02I02only02told02him02as02we02came02along02that02he02was02like02
Romeo...02and02proved02it.02And02that02was02all,02I02think!"0202
"Pig!"02ejaculated02Razumihin,02without02turning02round.0202
"There02must02have02been02very02grave02grounds02for02it,02if02he02
is02so02furious02at02the02word,"02Porfiry02laughed.0202
"Oh,02you02sharp02lawyer!...02Damn02you02all!"02snapped02
Razumihin,02and02suddenly02bursting02out02laughing02himself,02he02
went02up02to02Porfiry02with02a02more02cheerful02face02as02though02
nothing02had02happened.02"That'll02do!02We02are02all02fools.02To02
come02to02business.02This02is02my02friend02Rodion02Romanovitch02
Raskolnikov;02in02the02first02place02he02has02heard02of02you02and02
wants02to02make02your02acquaintance,02and02secondly,02he02has02a02
little02matter02of02business02with02you.02Bah!02Zametov,02what02
brought02you02here?02Have02you02met02before?02Have02you02known02
each02other02long?"0202
"What02does02this02mean?"02thought02Raskolnikov02uneasily.0202
Zametov02seemed02taken02aback,02but02not02very02much02so.0202
"Why,02it02was02at02your02rooms02we02met02yesterday,"02he02said02
easily.0202
"Then02I02have02been02spared02the02trouble.02All02last02week02he02
was02begging02me02to02introduce02him02to02you.02Porfiry02and02you02
have02sniffed02each02other02out02without02me.02Where02is02your02
tobacco?"0202
Porfiry02Petrovitch02was02wearing02a02dressing\gown,02very02
clean02linen,02and02trodden\down02slippers.02He02was02a02man02of02
about02five02and02thirty,02short,02stout02even02to02corpulence,02and02
clean02shaven.02He02wore02his02hair02cut02short02and02had02a02large02
round02head,02particularly02prominent02at02the02back.02His02soft,02
round,02rather02snub\nosed02face02was02of02a02sickly02yellowish02
colour,02but02had02a02vigorous02and02rather02ironical02expression.02
It02would02have02been02good\natured02except02for02a02look02in02the02
eyes,02which02shone02with02a02watery,02mawkish02light02under02
almost02white,02blinking02eyelashes.02The02expression02of02those02
eyes02was02strangely02out02of02keeping02with02his02somewhat02
womanish02figure,02and02gave02it02something02far02more02serious02
than02could02be02guessed02at02first02sight.0202
As02soon02as02Porfiry02Petrovitch02heard02that02his02visitor02had02
a02little02matter02of02business02with02him,02he02begged02him02to02sit02
down02on02the02sofa02and02sat02down02himself02on02the02other02end,02
waiting02for02him02to02explain02his02business,02with02that02careful02
and02over\serious02attention02which02is02at02once02oppressive02
and02embarrassing,02especially02to02a02stranger,02and02especially02
if02what02you02are02discussing02is02in02your02opinion02of02far02too02
little02importance02for02such02exceptional02solemnity.02But02in02
brief02and02coherent02phrases02Raskolnikov02explained02his02
business02clearly02and02exactly,02and02was02so02well02satisfied02with02
himself02that02he02even02succeeded02in02taking02a02good02look02at02
Porfiry.02Porfiry02Petrovitch02did02not02once02take02his02eyes02off02
him.02Razumihin,02sitting02opposite02at02the02same02table,02
listened02warmly02and02impatiently,02looking02from02one02to02the02
other02every02moment02with02rather02excessive02interest.0202
"Fool,"02Raskolnikov02swore02to02himself.0202
"You02have02to02give02information02to02the02police,"02Porfiry02
replied,02with02a02most02businesslike02air,02"that02having02learnt02of02
this02incident,02that02is02of02the02murder,02you02beg02to02inform02the02
lawyer02in02charge02of02the02case02that02such02and02such02things02
belong02to02you,02and02that02you02desire02to02redeem02them...02or...02
but02they02will02write02to02you."0202
"That's02just02the02point,02that02at02the02present02moment,"02
Raskolnikov02tried02his02utmost02to02feign02embarrassment,02"I02
am02not02quite02in02funds...02and02even02this02trifling02sum02is02
beyond02me...02I02only02wanted,02you02see,02for02the02present02to02
declare02that02the02things02are02mine,02and02that02when02I02have02
money...."0202
"That's02 no02 matter,"02 answered02 Porfiry02 Petrovitch,02
receiving02his02explanation02of02his02pecuniary02position02coldly,02
"but02you02can,02if02you02prefer,02write02straight02to02me,02to02say,02that02
having02been02informed02of02the02matter,02and02claiming02such02and02
such02as02your02property,02you02beg..."0202
"On02 an02 ordinary02 sheet02 of02 paper?"02 Raskolnikov02
interrupted02eagerly,02again02interested02in02the02financial02side02
of02the02question.0202
"Oh,02
the02 most02 ordinary,"02 and02 suddenly02 Porfiry02
Petrovitch02looked02with02obvious02irony02at02him,02screwing02up02
his02eyes02and,02as02it02were,02winking02at02him.02But02perhaps02it02was02
Raskolnikov's02fancy,02for02it02all02lasted02but02a02moment.02There02
was02certainly02something02of02the02sort,02Raskolnikov02could02
have02sworn02he02winked02at02him,02goodness02knows02why.0202
"He02knows,"02flashed02through02his02mind02like02lightning.0202
"Forgive02my02troubling02you02about02such02trifles,"02he02went02
on,02a02little02disconcerted,02"the02things02are02only02worth02five02
roubles,02but02I02prize02them02particularly02for02the02sake02of02those02
from02whom02they02came02to02me,02and02I02must02confess02that02I02was02
alarmed02when02I02heard..."0202
"That's02 why02 you02 were02 so02 much02 struck02 when02 I02
mentioned02to02Zossimov02that02Porfiry02was02inquiring02for02
everyone02who02had02pledges!"02Razumihin02put02in02with02
obvious02intention.0202
This02was02really02unbearable.02Raskolnikov02could02not02help02
glancing02at02him02with02a02flash02of02vindictive02anger02in02his02black02
eyes,02but02immediately02recollected02himself.0202
"You02seem02to02be02jeering02at02me,02brother?"02he02said02to02him,02
with02a02well\feigned02irritability.02"I02dare02say02I02do02seem02to02you02
absurdly02anxious02about02such02trash;02but02you02mustn't02think02
me02selfish02or02grasping02for02that,02and02these02two02things02may02
be02anything02but02trash02in02my02eyes.02I02told02you02just02now02that02
the02silver02watch,02though02it's02not02worth02a02cent,02is02the02only02
thing02left02us02of02my02father's.02You02may02laugh02at02me,02but02my02
mother02is02here,"02he02turned02suddenly02to02Porfiry,02"and02if02she02
knew,"02he02turned02again02hurriedly02to02Razumihin,02carefully02
making02his02voice02tremble,02"that02the02watch02was02lost,02she02
would02be02in02despair!02You02know02what02women02are!"0202
"Not02a02bit02of02it!02I02didn't02mean02that02at02all!02Quite02the02
contrary!"02shouted02Razumihin02distressed.0202
"Was02it02right?02Was02it02natural?02Did02I02overdo02it?"02
Raskolnikov02asked02himself02in02a02tremor.02"Why02did02I02say02that02
about02women?"0202
"Oh,02your02mother02is02with02you?"02Porfiry02Petrovitch02
inquired.0202
"Yes."0202
"When02did02she02come?"0202
"Last02night."0202
Porfiry02paused02as02though02reflecting.0202
"Your02things02would02not02in02any02case02be02lost,"02he02went02on02
calmly02and02coldly.02"I02have02been02expecting02you02here02for02
some02time."0202
And02as02though02that02was02a02matter02of02no02importance,02he02
carefully02offered02the02ash\tray02to02Razumihin,02who02was02
ruthlessly02 scattering02 cigarette02 ash02 over02 the02 carpet.02
Raskolnikov02shuddered,02but02Porfiry02did02not02seem02to02be02
looking02at02him,02and02was02still02concerned02with02Razumihin's02
cigarette.0202
"What?02Expecting02him?02Why,02did02you02know02that02he02had02
pledges02there?"02cried02Razumihin.0202
Porfiry02Petrovitch02addressed02himself02to02Raskolnikov.0202
"Your02things,02the02ring02and02the02watch,02were02wrapped02up02
together,02and02on02the02paper02your02name02was02legibly02written02
in02pencil,02together02with02the02date02on02which02you02left02them02
with02her..."0202
"How02 observant02 you02 are!"02 Raskolnikov02 smiled02
awkwardly,02doing02his02very02utmost02to02look02him02straight02in02
the02face,02but02he02failed,02and02suddenly02added:0202
"I02say02that02because02I02suppose02there02were02a02great02many02
pledges...02that02it02must02be02difficult02to02remember02them02all....02
But02you02remember02them02all02so02clearly,02and...02and..."0202
"Stupid!02Feeble!"02he02thought.02"Why02did02I02add02that?"0202
"But02we02know02all02who02had02pledges,02and02you02are02the02
only02one02who02hasn't02come02forward,"02Porfiry02answered02
with02hardly02perceptible02irony.0202
"I02haven't02been02quite02well."0202
"I02heard02that02too.02I02heard,02indeed,02that02you02were02in02great02
distress02about02something.02You02look02pale02still."0202
"I02am02not02pale02at02all....02No,02I02am02quite02well,"02Raskolnikov02
snapped02out02rudely02and02angrily,02completely02changing02his02
tone.02His02anger02was02mounting,02he02could02not02repress02it.02
"And02in02my02anger02I02shall02betray02myself,"02flashed02through02
his02mind02again.02"Why02are02they02torturing02me?"0202
"Not02quite02well!"02Razumihin02caught02him02up.02"What02next!02

"Nonsense!02Don't02you02believe02it!02But02you02don't02believe02it02

Petrovitch02did02not02seem02to02catch02those02strange02words.0202
"But02how02could02you02have02gone02out02if02you02hadn't02been02

defiance,02"I02ran02away02from02them02to02take02lodgings02where02

He02could02have02strangled02Zametov02at02that02moment,02so02

"In02my02opinion02you02talked02sensibly02and02even02artfully,02

dryly.0202
"And02Nikodim02Fomitch02was02telling02me02to\day,"02put02in02

"Get02along02with02you!"0202
Porfiry02Petrovitch02went02out02to02order02tea.0202

terrible02exasperation.0202

All02this02flashed02like02lightning02through02his02mind.0202
Porfiry02 Petrovitch02 returned02 quickly.02 He02 became02
suddenly02more02jovial.0202
"Your02party02yesterday,02brother,02has02left02my02head02

"What02

"The02question02wasn't02put02quite02like02that,"02observed02
Porfiry.0202
"Not02quite,02that's02true,"02Razumihin02agreed02at02once,02

Raskolnikov02smiled02at02the02exaggerated02and02intentional02
distortion02of02his02idea.0202
"What?02What02do02you02mean?02A02right02to02crime?02But02not02
because02of02the02influence02of02environment?"02Razumihin02
inquired02with02some02alarm02even.0202
"No,02not02exactly02because02of02it,"02answered02Porfiry.02"In02his02
'ordinary'02 and02

"What02do02you02mean?02That02can't02be02right?"02Razumihin02
muttered02in02bewilderment.0202
Raskolnikov02smiled02again.02He02saw02the02point02at02once,02
and02knew02where02they02wanted02to02drive02him.02He02decided02to02
take02up02the02challenge.0202
"That02wasn't02quite02my02contention,"02he02began02simply02
and02modestly.02"Yet02I02admit02that02you02have02stated02it02almost02
correctly;02perhaps,02if02you02like,02perfectly02so."02(It02almost02gave02
him02pleasure02to02admit02this.)02"The02only02difference02is02that02I02
don't02contend02that02extraordinary02people02are02always02bound02
into02
to02commit02breaches02of02morals,02as02you02call02it.02In02fact,02I02doubt02
whether02such02an02argument02could02be02published.02I02simply02
hinted02that02an02'extraordinary'02man02has02the02right...02that02is02

You02say02that02my02article02isn't02definite;02I02am02ready02to02make02it02
as02clear02as02I02can.02Perhaps02I02am02right02in02thinking02you02want02
me02to;02very02well.02I02maintain02that02if02the02discoveries02of02
Kepler02and02Newton02could02not02have02been02made02known02
except02by02sacrificing02the02lives02of02one,02a02dozen,02a02hundred,02

and02left02and02to02steal02every02day02in02the02market.02Then,02I02
remember,02I02maintain02in02my02article02that02all...02well,02
legislators02and02leaders02of02men,02such02as02Lycurgus,02Solon,02
Mahomet,02Napoleon,02and02so02on,02were02all02without02exception02
criminals,02from02the02very02fact02that,02making02a02new02law,02they02
transgressed02the02ancient02one,02handed02down02from02their02
ancestors02and02held02sacred02by02the02people,02and02they02did02not02
stop02short02at02bloodshed02either,02if02that02bloodshed―often02of02
innocent02persons02fighting02bravely02in02defence02of02ancient02
law―were02of02use02to02their02cause.02It's02remarkable,02in02fact,02
that02the02majority,02indeed,02of02these02benefactors02and02leaders02
of02humanity02were02guilty02of02terrible02carnage.02In02short,02I02
maintain02that02all02great02men02or02even02men02a02little02out02of02the02
common,02that02is02to02say02capable02of02giving02some02new02word,02
must02from02their02very02nature02be02criminals―more02or02less,02of02
course.02Otherwise02it's02hard02for02them02to02get02out02of02the02
common02rut;02and02to02remain02in02the02common02rut02is02what02
they02can't02submit02to,02from02their02very02nature02again,02and02to02
my02mind02they02ought02not,02indeed,02to02submit02to02it.02You02see02
that02there02is02nothing02particularly02new02in02all02that.02The02same02
thing02has02been02printed02and02read02a02thousand02times02before.02
into02 ordinary02 and02
for02 my02 division02 of02 people02
As02
extraordinary,02I02acknowledge02that02it's02somewhat02arbitrary,02
but02I02don't02insist02upon02exact02numbers.02I02only02believe02in02my02
leading02idea02that02men02are02 in02general02divided02by02a02law02of02
nature02into02two02categories,02inferior02(ordinary),02that02is,02so02
to02say,02material02that02serves02only02to02reproduce02its02kind,02and02
men02who02have02the02gift02or02the02talent02to02utter02 a02new02word.02
There02are,02of02course,02innumerable02sub\divisions,02but02the02
distinguishing02features02of02both02categories02are02fairly02well02
marked.02The02first02category,02generally02speaking,02are02men02
conservative02in02temperament02and02law\abiding;02they02live02
under02control02and02love02to02be02controlled.02To02my02thinking02it02
is02their02duty02to02be02controlled,02because02that's02their02vocation,02
and02there02is02nothing02humiliating02in02it02for02them.02The02second02
category02all02transgress02the02law;02they02are02destroyers02or02
disposed02to02destruction02according02to02their02capacities.02The02
crimes02of02these02men02are02of02course02relative02and02varied;02for02
the02most02part02they02seek02in02very02varied02ways02the02
destruction02of02the02present02for02the02sake02of02the02better.02But02if02
such02a02one02is02forced02for02the02sake02of02his02idea02to02step02over02a02
corpse02or02wade02through02blood,02he02can,02I02maintain,02find02
within02himself,02in02his02conscience,02a02sanction02for02wading02
through02 blood―that02 depends02 on02 the02
its02

dimensions,02note02that.02It's02only02in02that02sense02I02speak02of02
their02right02to02crime02in02my02article02(you02remember02it02began02
with02the02legal02question).02There's02no02need02for02such02anxiety,02
however;02the02masses02will02scarcely02ever02admit02this02right,02
they02punish02them02or02hang02them02(more02or02less),02and02in02
doing02so02fulfil02quite02justly02their02conservative02vocation.02But02
the02same02masses02set02these02criminals02on02a02pedestal02in02the02
next02generation02and02worship02them02(more02or02less).02The02first02
category02is02always02the02man02of02the02present,02the02second02the02

"Then02you02believe02in02the02New02Jerusalem,02do02you?"0202
"I02do,"02Raskolnikov02answered02firmly;02as02he02said02these02

"You02believe02it02literally?"0202
"Literally."0202
"You02don't02say02so....02I02asked02from02curiosity.02Excuse02me.02

Raskolnikov02raised02his02pale02and02almost02mournful02face02

or02prohibition.02He02will02suffer02if02he02is02sorry02for02his02victim.02
Pain02and02suffering02are02always02inevitable02for02a02large02
intelligence02and02a02deep02heart.02The02really02great02men02must,02I02
think,02have02great02sadness02on02earth,"02he02added02dreamily,02
not02in02the02tone02of02the02conversation.0202
He02raised02his02eyes,02looked02earnestly02at02them02all,02smiled,02
and02took02his02cap.02He02was02too02quiet02by02comparison02with02his02
manner02at02his02entrance,02and02he02felt02this.02Everyone02got02up.0202
"Well,02you02may02abuse02me,02be02angry02with02me02if02you02like,"02
Porfiry02Petrovitch02began02again,02"but02I02can't02resist.02Allow02
me02one02little02question02(I02know02I02am02troubling02you).02There02
is02just02one02little02notion02I02want02to02express,02simply02that02I02may02
not02forget02it."0202
"Very02good,02tell02me02your02little02notion,"02Raskolnikov02
stood02waiting,02pale02and02grave02before02him.0202
"Well,02you02see...02I02really02don't02know02how02to02express02it02
properly....02It's02a02playful,02psychological02idea....02When02you02
were02writing02your02article,02surely02you02couldn't02have02helped,02
he\he!02fancying02yourself...02just02a02little,02an02'extraordinary'02
possibly,"02
man,02uttering02a02 new02word02in02your02sense....02That's02so,02isn't02
it?"0202"Quite02
answered02
Raskolnikov02
contemptuously.0202
Razumihin02made02a02movement.0202
"And,02if02so,02could02you02bring02yourself02in02case02of02worldly02
for02 some02 service02
difficulties02 and02 hardship02 or02
to02
humanity―to02overstep02obstacles?...02For02instance,02to02rob02
and02murder?"0202
And02again02he02winked02with02his02left02eye,02and02laughed02
noiselessly02just02as02before.0202
"If02I02did02I02certainly02should02not02tell02you,"02Raskolnikov02
answered02with02defiant02and02haughty02contempt.0202
"No,02I02was02only02interested02on02account02of02your02article,02
from02a02literary02point02of02view..."0202
"Foo!02how02obvious02and02insolent02that02is!"02Raskolnikov02
thought02with02repulsion.0202
"Allow02me02to02observe,"02he02answered02dryly,02"that02I02don't02
consider02myself02a02Mahomet02or02a02Napoleon,02nor02any02
personage02of02that02kind,02and02not02being02one02of02them02I02cannot02

"Oh,02come,02don't02we02all02think02ourselves02Napoleons02now02
in02 Russia?"02 Porfiry02 Petrovitch02 said02 with02 alarming02
familiarity.0202
the02 very02
Something02 peculiar02 betrayed02
intonation02of02his02voice.0202
"Perhaps02it02was02one02of02these02future02Napoleons02who02did02
for02Alyona02Ivanovna02last02week?"02Zametov02blurted02out02from02
the02corner.0202
Raskolnikov02did02not02speak,02but02looked02firmly02and02
intently02at02Porfiry.02Razumihin02was02scowling02gloomily.02He02
seemed02before02this02to02be02noticing02something.02He02looked02
itself02
in02
angrily02around.02There02was02a02minute02of02gloomy02silence.02
Raskolnikov02turned02to02go.0202
"Are02you02going02already?"02Porfiry02said02amiably,02holding02
out02his02hand02with02excessive02politeness.02"Very,02very02glad02of02
your02 acquaintance.02 As02
for02 your02 request,02 have02 no02
uneasiness,02write02just02as02I02told02you,02or,02better02still,02come02to02
me02there02yourself02in02a02day02or02two...02to\morrow,02indeed.02I02
shall02be02there02at02eleven02o'clock02for02certain.02We'll02arrange02it02
all;02we'll02have02a02talk.02As02one02of02the02last02to02be02 there,02you02
might02perhaps02be02able02to02tell02us02something,"02he02added02with02
a02most02good\natured02expression.0202
"You02want02to02cross\examine02me02officially02in02due02form?"02
Raskolnikov02asked02sharply.0202
"Oh,02why?02That's02not02necessary02for02the02present.02You02
misunderstand02me.02I02lose02no02opportunity,02you02see,02and...02
I've02talked02with02all02who02had02pledges....02I02obtained02evidence02
from02some02of02them,02and02you02are02the02last....02Yes,02by02the02way,"02
he02cried,02seemingly02suddenly02delighted,02"I02just02remember,02
what02was02I02thinking02of?"02he02turned02to02Razumihin,02"you02
were02talking02my02ears02off02about02that02Nikolay...02of02course,02I02
know,02I02know02very02well,"02he02turned02to02Raskolnikov,02"that02
the02fellow02is02innocent,02but02what02is02one02to02do?02We02had02to02
trouble02Dmitri02too....02This02is02the02point,02this02is02all:02when02you02
went02up02the02stairs02it02was02past02seven,02wasn't02it?"0202
"Yes,"02answered02Raskolnikov,02with02an02unpleasant02
sensation02at02the02very02moment02he02spoke02that02he02need02not02
have02said02it.0202
"Then02when02you02went02upstairs02between02seven02and02
eight,02didn't02you02see02in02a02flat02that02stood02open02on02a02second02
storey,02do02you02remember?02two02workmen02or02at02least02one02of02
them?02They02were02painting02there,02didn't02you02notice02them?02
It's02very,02very02important02for02them."0202
I02 didn't02 see02
"Painters?02 No,02
them,"02 Raskolnikov02
answered02slowly,02as02though02ransacking02his02memory,02while02
at02the02same02instant02he02was02racking02every02nerve,02almost02
swooning02with02anxiety02to02conjecture02as02quickly02as02possible02
where02the02trap02lay02and02not02to02overlook02anything.02"No,02I02
didn't02see02them,02and02I02don't02think02I02noticed02a02flat02like02that02
open....02But02on02the02fourth02storey"02(he02had02mastered02the02
trap02now02and02was02triumphant)02"I02remember02now02that02
someone02was02moving02out02of02the02flat02opposite02Alyona02
Ivanovna's....02I02remember...02I02remember02it02clearly.02Some02
porters02were02carrying02out02a02sofa02and02they02squeezed02me02
against02the02wall.02But02painters...02no,02I02don't02remember02that02
there02were02any02painters,02and02I02don't02think02that02there02was02a02
flat02open02anywhere,02no,02there02wasn't."0202
"What02do02you02mean?"02Razumihin02shouted02suddenly,02as02
though02he02had02reflected02and02realised.02"Why,02it02was02on02the02
day02of02the02murder02the02painters02were02at02work,02and02he02was02
there02three02days02before?02What02are02you02asking?"0202
"Foo!02I02have02muddled02it!"02Porfiry02slapped02himself02on02the02
forehead.02"Deuce02take02it!02This02business02is02turning02my02
somewhat02
Raskolnikov02
he02
brain!"02
apologetically.02"It02would02be02such02a02great02thing02for02us02to02
find02out02whether02anyone02had02seen02them02between02seven02
and02eight02at02the02flat,02so02I02fancied02you02could02perhaps02have02
told02us02something....02I02quite02muddled02it."0202
"Then02 you02 should02 be02 more02 careful,"02 Razumihin02
observed02grimly.0202
The02last02words02were02uttered02in02the02passage.02Porfiry02
Petrovitch02saw02them02to02the02door02with02excessive02politeness.0202
They02went02out02into02the02street02gloomy02and02sullen,02and02
for02some02steps02they02did02not02say02a02word.02Raskolnikov02drew02
a02deep02breath.0202

it,02 I02 can't02 believe02
"I02 don't02 believe02
it!"02 repeated02
Razumihin,02trying02in02perplexity02to02refute02Raskolnikov's02
arguments.0202
They02were02by02now02approaching02Bakaleyev's02lodgings,02
where02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02and02Dounia02had02been02
expecting02them02a02long02while.02Razumihin02kept02stopping02on02
the02way02in02the02heat02of02discussion,02confused02and02excited02by02
the02very02fact02that02they02were02for02the02first02time02speaking02
openly02about02it.0202
"Don't02believe02it,02then!"02answered02Raskolnikov,02with02a02
cold,02careless02smile.02"You02were02noticing02nothing02as02usual,02
but02I02was02weighing02every02word."0202
"You02are02suspicious.02That02is02why02you02weighed02their02
words...02h'm...02certainly,02I02agree,02Porfiry's02tone02was02rather02
strange,02and02still02more02that02wretch02Zametov!...02You02are02
right,02there02was02something02about02him―but02why?02Why?"0202
"He02has02changed02his02mind02since02last02night."0202
"Quite02the02contrary!02If02they02had02that02brainless02idea,02they02
would02do02their02utmost02to02hide02it,02and02conceal02their02cards,02
so02as02to02catch02you02afterwards....02But02it02was02all02impudent02
and02careless."0202
"If02they02had02had02facts―I02mean,02real02facts―or02at02least02
grounds02for02suspicion,02then02they02would02certainly02have02
tried02to02hide02their02game,02in02the02hope02of02getting02more02(they02
would02have02made02a02search02long02ago02besides).02But02they02
have02no02facts,02not02one.02It02is02all02mirage―all02ambiguous.02
Simply02a02floating02idea.02So02they02try02to02throw02me02out02by02
impudence.02And02perhaps,02he02was02irritated02at02having02no02
facts,02and02blurted02it02out02in02his02vexation―or02perhaps02he02has02
some02plan...02he02seems02an02intelligent02man.02Perhaps02he02
wanted02to02frighten02me02by02pretending02to02know.02They02have02a02
psychology02of02their02own,02brother.02But02it02is02loathsome02

"And02it's02insulting,02insulting!02I02understand02you.02But...02

"He02really02has02put02it02well,02though,"02Raskolnikov02
thought.0202
"Damn02them?02But02the02cross\examination02again,02to\

"Damn02it!02I02will02go02myself02to02Porfiry.02I02will02squeeze02it02out02

"At02last02he02sees02through02him!"02thought02Raskolnikov.0202
"Stay!"02cried02Razumihin,02seizing02him02by02the02shoulder02
again.02"Stay!02you02were02wrong.02I02have02thought02it02out.02You02
are02wrong!02How02was02that02a02trap?02You02say02that02the02question02
about02the02workmen02was02a02trap.02But02if02you02had02done02that,02
could02you02have02said02you02had02seen02them02painting02the02flat...02
and02the02workmen?02On02the02contrary,02you02would02have02seen02
nothing,02even02if02you02had02seen02it.02Who02would02own02it02against02
himself?"0202
"If02I02had02done02 that02thing,02I02should02certainly02have02said02
that02I02had02seen02the02workmen02and02the02flat,"02Raskolnikov02
answered,02with02reluctance02and02obvious02disgust.0202
"But02why02speak02against02yourself?"0202
"Because02only02peasants,02or02the02most02inexperienced02
novices02deny02everything02flatly02at02examinations.02If02a02man02is02
ever02so02little02developed02and02experienced,02he02will02certainly02
try02to02admit02all02the02external02facts02that02can't02be02avoided,02but02
will02seek02other02explanations02of02them,02will02introduce02some02
special,02unexpected02turn,02that02will02give02them02another02
significance02and02put02them02in02another02light.02Porfiry02might02
well02reckon02that02I02should02be02sure02to02answer02so,02and02say02I02
had02seen02them02to02give02an02air02of02truth,02and02then02make02some02
explanation."0202
"But02he02would02have02told02you02at02once02that02the02workmen02
could02not02have02been02there02two02days02before,02and02that02
therefore02you02must02have02been02there02on02the02day02of02the02
murder02at02eight02o'clock.02And02so02he02would02have02caught02you02
over02a02detail."0202
"Yes,02that02is02what02he02was02reckoning02on,02that02I02should02
not02have02time02to02reflect,02and02should02be02in02a02hurry02to02make02
the02most02likely02answer,02and02so02would02forget02that02the02
workmen02could02not02have02been02there02two02days02before."0202
"But02how02could02you02forget02it?"0202
"Nothing02easier.02It02is02in02just02such02stupid02things02clever02

"He02is02a02knave02then,02if02that02is02so!"0202
Raskolnikov02could02not02help02laughing.02But02at02the02very02
moment,02he02was02struck02by02the02strangeness02of02his02own02
frankness,02and02the02eagerness02with02which02he02had02made02this02
explanation,02though02he02had02kept02up02all02the02preceding02
conversation02with02gloomy02repulsion,02obviously02with02a02
motive,02from02necessity.0202
"I02am02getting02a02relish02for02certain02aspects!"02he02thought02to02
himself.02But02almost02at02the02same02instant02he02became02
suddenly02uneasy,02as02though02an02unexpected02and02alarming02
idea02had02occurred02to02him.02His02uneasiness02kept02on02
increasing.02 They02 had02
just02 reached02 the02 entrance02 to02
Bakaleyev's.0202
"Go02in02alone!"02said02Raskolnikov02suddenly.02"I02will02be02
back02directly."0202
"Where02are02you02going?02Why,02we02are02just02here."0202
"I02can't02help02it....02I02will02come02in02half02an02hour.02Tell02them."0202
"Say02what02you02like,02I02will02come02with02you."0202
"You,02too,02want02to02torture02me!"02he02screamed,02with02such02
bitter02irritation,02such02despair02in02his02eyes02that02Razumihin's02
hands02dropped.02He02stood02for02some02time02on02the02steps,02
looking02gloomily02at02Raskolnikov02striding02rapidly02away02in02
the02direction02of02his02lodging.02At02last,02gritting02his02teeth02and02
clenching02his02fist,02he02swore02he02would02squeeze02Porfiry02like02a02
lemon02that02very02day,02and02went02up02the02stairs02to02reassure02
Pulcheria02Alexandrovna,02who02was02by02now02alarmed02at02their02
long02absence.0202
When02Raskolnikov02got02home,02his02hair02was02soaked02with02
sweat02and02he02was02breathing02heavily.02He02went02rapidly02up02
the02stairs,02walked02into02his02unlocked02room02and02at02once02
fastened02the02latch.02Then02in02senseless02terror02he02rushed02to02
the02corner,02to02that02hole02under02the02paper02where02he02had02put02
the02things;02put02his02hand02in,02and02for02some02minutes02felt02
carefully02in02the02hole,02in02every02crack02and02fold02of02the02paper.02
Finding02nothing,02he02got02up02and02drew02a02deep02breath.02As02he02
was02reaching02the02steps02of02Bakaleyev's,02he02suddenly02fancied02
that02something,02a02chain,02a02stud02or02even02a02bit02of02paper02in02
which02they02had02been02wrapped02with02the02old02woman's02
handwriting02on02it,02might02somehow02have02slipped02out02and02
been02lost02in02some02crack,02and02then02might02suddenly02turn02up02
as02unexpected,02conclusive02evidence02against02him.0202
He02stood02as02though02lost02in02thought,02and02a02strange,02
humiliated,02half02senseless02smile02strayed02on02his02lips.02He02
took02his02cap02at02last02and02went02quietly02out02of02the02room.02His02
ideas02were02all02tangled.02He02went02dreamily02through02the02
gateway.0202
"Here02he02is02himself,"02shouted02a02loud02voice.0202
He02raised02his02head.0202
The02porter02was02standing02at02the02door02of02his02little02room02
and02was02pointing02him02out02to02a02short02man02who02looked02like02
an02artisan,02wearing02a02long02coat02and02a02waistcoat,02and02
looking02at02a02distance02remarkably02like02a02woman.02He02
stooped,02and02his02head02in02a02greasy02cap02hung02forward.02From02
his02wrinkled02flabby02face02he02looked02over02fifty;02his02little02eyes02
were02lost02in02fat02and02they02looked02out02grimly,02sternly02and02
discontentedly.0202
"What02is02it?"02Raskolnikov02asked,02going02up02to02the02porter.0202
The02man02stole02a02look02at02him02from02under02his02brows02and02
he02looked02at02him02attentively,02deliberately;02then02he02turned02
slowly02and02went02out02of02the02gate02into02the02street02without02
saying02a02word.0202
"What02is02it?"02cried02Raskolnikov.0202
"Why,02he02there02was02asking02whether02a02student02lived02
here,02mentioned02your02name02and02whom02you02lodged02with.02I02
saw02you02coming02and02pointed02you02out02and02he02went02away.02
It's02funny."0202
The02porter02too02seemed02rather02puzzled,02but02not02much02so,02
and02after02wondering02for02a02moment02he02turned02and02went02
back02to02his02room.0202
Raskolnikov02ran02after02the02stranger,02and02at02once02caught02
sight02of02him02walking02along02the02other02side02of02the02street02with02
the02same02even,02deliberate02step02with02his02eyes02fixed02on02the02
ground,02as02though02in02meditation.02He02soon02overtook02him,02
but02for02some02time02walked02behind02him.02At02last,02moving02on02
to02a02level02with02him,02he02looked02at02his02face.02The02man02noticed02
him02at02once,02looked02at02him02quickly,02but02dropped02his02eyes02
again;02and02so02they02walked02for02a02minute02side02by02side02
without02uttering02a02word.0202
"You02 were02
the02 porter?"02
inquiring02
Raskolnikov02said02at02last,02but02in02a02curiously02quiet02voice.0202
The02man02made02no02answer;02he02didn't02even02look02at02him.02
Again02they02were02both02silent.0202
"Why02do02you...02come02and02ask02for02me...02and02say02nothing....02
What's02the02meaning02of02it?"0202
Raskolnikov's02voice02broke02and02he02seemed02unable02to02
articulate02the02words02clearly.0202
The02man02raised02his02eyes02this02time02and02turned02a02gloomy02
sinister02look02at02Raskolnikov.0202
for02 me...02 of02
"Murderer!"02he02said02suddenly02in02a02quiet02but02clear02and02
distinct02voice.0202
Raskolnikov02went02on02walking02beside02him.02His02legs02felt02
suddenly02weak,02a02cold02shiver02ran02down02his02spine,02and02his02
heart02seemed02to02stand02still02for02a02moment,02then02suddenly02
began02throbbing02as02though02it02were02set02free.02So02they02walked02
for02about02a02hundred02paces,02side02by02side02in02silence.0202
The02man02did02not02look02at02him.0202
"What02do02you02mean...02what02is....02Who02is02a02murderer?"02
muttered02Raskolnikov02hardly02audibly.0202
"You02are02a02murderer,"02the02man02answered02still02more02
articulately02and02emphatically,02with02a02smile02of02triumphant02
hatred,02and02again02he02looked02straight02into02Raskolnikov's02
pale02face02and02stricken02eyes.0202
They02had02just02reached02the02cross\roads.02The02man02turned02
to02the02left02without02looking02behind02him.02Raskolnikov02
remained02standing,02gazing02after02him.02He02saw02him02turn02
round02fifty02paces02away02and02look02back02at02him02still02standing02
there.02Raskolnikov02could02not02see02clearly,02but02he02fancied02
that02he02was02again02smiling02the02same02smile02of02cold02hatred02
and02triumph.0202
With02 slow02
faltering02 steps,02 with02 shaking02 knees,02
Raskolnikov02made02his02way02back02to02his02little02garret,02feeling02
chilled02all02over.02He02took02off02his02cap02and02put02it02on02the02table,02
and02for02ten02minutes02he02stood02without02moving.02Then02he02
sank02exhausted02on02the02sofa02and02with02a02weak02moan02of02pain02
he02stretched02himself02on02it.02So02he02lay02for02half02an02hour.0202
He02thought02of02nothing.02Some02thoughts02or02fragments02of02
thoughts,02some02images02without02order02or02coherence02floated02
before02his02mind―faces02of02people02he02had02seen02in02his02
childhood02or02met02somewhere02once,02whom02he02would02never02
have02recalled,02the02belfry02of02the02church02at02V.,02the02billiard02

tavern02room,02a02back02staircase02quite02dark,02all02sloppy02with02
dirty02water02and02strewn02with02egg\shells,02and02the02Sunday02
bells02floating02in02from02somewhere....02The02images02followed02
one02another,02whirling02like02a02hurricane.02Some02of02them02he02
liked02and02tried02to02clutch02at,02but02they02faded02and02all02the02while02
there02was02an02oppression02within02him,02but02it02was02not02
overwhelming,02sometimes02it02was02even02pleasant....02The02
slight02shivering02still02persisted,02but02that02too02was02an02almost02
pleasant02sensation.0202
He02heard02the02hurried02footsteps02of02Razumihin;02he02closed02
his02eyes02and02pretended02to02be02asleep.02Razumihin02opened02
the02door02and02stood02for02some02time02in02the02doorway02as02
though02hesitating,02then02he02stepped02softly02into02the02room02
and02went02cautiously02to02the02sofa.02Raskolnikov02heard02
Nastasya's02whisper:0202
"Don't02disturb02him!02Let02him02sleep.02He02can02have02his02
dinner02later."0202
"Quite02 so,"02 answered02 Razumihin.02 Both02 withdrew02
carefully02and02closed02the02door.02Another02half\hour02passed.02
Raskolnikov02opened02his02eyes,02turned02on02his02back02again,02
clasping02his02hands02behind02his02head.0202
"Who02is02he?02Who02is02that02man02who02sprang02out02of02the02
earth?02Where02was02he,02what02did02he02see?02He02has02seen02it02all,02

how02could02he02see?02Is02it02possible?02Hm..."02continued02
Raskolnikov,02turning02cold02and02shivering,02"and02the02jewel02

physically02weak02he02had02become.02"I02ought02to02have02known02
it,"02he02thought02with02a02bitter02smile.02"And02how02dared02I,02

but02I02did02know!"02he02whispered02in02despair.02At02times02he02
came02to02a02standstill02at02some02thought.0202
"No,02those02men02are02not02made02so.02The02real02 Master02to02

One02sudden02irrelevant02idea02almost02made02him02laugh.02

At02moments02he02felt02he02was02raving.02He02sank02into02a02state02
of02
feverish02 excitement.02 "The02 old02 woman02
is02 of02 no02

He02lost02consciousness;02it02seemed02strange02to02him02that02he02
didn't02remember02how02he02got02into02the02street.02It02was02late02
evening.02The02twilight02had02fallen02and02the02full02moon02was02
shining02more02and02more02brightly;02but02there02was02a02peculiar02
breathlessness02in02the02air.02There02were02crowds02of02people02in02
the02street;02workmen02and02business02people02were02making02
their02way02home;02other02people02had02come02out02for02a02walk;02
there02was02a02smell02of02mortar,02dust02and02stagnant02water.02
Raskolnikov02walked02along,02mournful02and02anxious;02he02was02
distinctly02aware02of02having02come02out02with02a02purpose,02of02
having02to02do02something02in02a02hurry,02but02what02it02was02he02had02

on02the02other02side02of02the02street,02beckoning02to02him.02He02
crossed02over02to02him,02but02at02once02the02man02turned02and02
walked02away02with02his02head02hanging,02as02though02he02had02
made02no02sign02to02him.02"Stay,02did02he02really02beckon?"02
Raskolnikov02wondered,02but02he02tried02to02overtake02him.02
When02he02was02within02ten02paces02he02recognised02him02and02was02
frightened;02it02was02the02same02man02with02stooping02shoulders02
in02the02long02coat.02Raskolnikov02followed02him02at02a02distance;02
his02heart02was02beating;02they02went02down02a02turning;02the02man02
still02did02not02look02round.02"Does02he02know02I02am02following02
him?"02thought02Raskolnikov.02The02man02went02into02the02
gateway02of02a02big02house.02Raskolnikov02hastened02to02the02gate02
and02looked02in02to02see02whether02he02would02look02round02and02
sign02to02him.02In02the02court\yard02the02man02did02turn02round02and02
again02seemed02to02beckon02him.02Raskolnikov02at02once02followed02
him02into02the02yard,02but02the02man02was02gone.02He02must02have02
gone02up02the02first02staircase.02Raskolnikov02rushed02after02him.02
He02heard02slow02measured02steps02two02flights02above.02The02
staircase02seemed02strangely02familiar.02He02reached02the02
window02on02the02first02floor;02the02moon02shone02through02the02
panes02with02a02melancholy02and02mysterious02light;02then02he02
reached02the02second02floor.02Bah!02this02is02the02flat02where02the02
painters02were02at02work...02but02how02was02it02he02did02not02
recognise02it02at02once?02The02steps02of02the02man02above02had02died02
away.02"So02he02must02have02stopped02or02hidden02somewhere."02
He02reached02the02third02storey,02should02he02go02on?02There02was02a02
stillness02that02was02dreadful....02But02he02went02on.02The02sound02of02
his02own02footsteps02scared02and02frightened02him.02How02dark02it02
was!02The02man02must02be02hiding02in02some02corner02here.02Ah!02the02
flat02was02standing02wide02open,02he02hesitated02and02went02in.02It02
was02very02dark02and02empty02in02the02passage,02as02though02
everything02had02been02removed;02he02crept02on02tiptoe02into02the02
parlour02which02was02flooded02with02moonlight.02Everything02
there02was02as02before,02the02chairs,02the02looking\glass,02the02
yellow02sofa02and02the02pictures02in02the02frames.02A02huge,02round,02
copper\red02moon02looked02in02at02the02windows.02"It's02the02moon02
that02makes02it02so02still,02weaving02some02mystery,"02thought02
Raskolnikov.02He02stood02and02waited,02waited02a02long02while,02
and02the02more02silent02the02moonlight,02the02more02violently02his02
heart02beat,02till02it02was02painful.02And02still02the02same02hush.02
Suddenly02he02heard02a02momentary02sharp02crack02like02the02
snapping02of02a02splinter02and02all02was02still02again.02A02fly02flew02up02
suddenly02and02struck02the02window02pane02with02a02plaintive02
buzz.02At02that02moment02he02noticed02in02the02corner02between02the02
window02and02the02little02cupboard02something02like02a02cloak02
hanging02on02the02wall.02"Why02is02that02cloak02here?"02he02thought,02
"it02wasn't02there02before...."02He02went02up02to02it02quietly02and02felt02
that02there02was02someone02hiding02behind02it.02He02cautiously02
moved02the02cloak02and02saw,02sitting02on02a02chair02in02the02corner,02
the02old02woman02bent02double02so02that02he02couldn't02see02her02
face;02but02it02was02she.02He02stood02over02her.02"She02is02afraid,"02he02
thought.02He02stealthily02took02the02axe02from02the02noose02and02
struck02her02one02blow,02then02another02on02the02skull.02But02strange02
to02say02she02did02not02stir,02as02though02she02were02made02of02wood.02
He02was02frightened,02bent02down02nearer02and02tried02to02look02at02
her;02but02she,02too,02bent02her02head02lower.02He02bent02right02down02
to02the02ground02and02peeped02up02into02her02face02from02below,02he02
peeped02and02turned02cold02with02horror:02the02old02woman02was02
sitting02and02laughing,02shaking02with02noiseless02laughter,02
doing02her02utmost02that02he02should02not02hear02it.02Suddenly02he02
fancied02that02the02door02from02the02bedroom02was02opened02a02
little02and02that02there02was02laughter02and02whispering02within.02
He02was02overcome02with02frenzy02and02he02began02hitting02the02old02
woman02on02the02head02with02all02his02force,02but02at02every02blow02of02
the02axe02the02laughter02and02whispering02from02the02bedroom02
grew02louder02and02the02old02woman02was02simply02shaking02with02
mirth.02He02was02rushing02away,02but02the02passage02was02full02of02
people,02the02doors02of02the02flats02stood02open02and02on02the02
landing,02on02the02stairs02and02everywhere02below02there02were02
people,02rows02of02heads,02all02looking,02but02huddled02together02in02
silence02and02expectation.02Something02gripped02his02heart,02his02
legs02were02rooted02to02the02spot,02they02would02not02move....02He02
tried02to02scream02and02woke02up.0202
He02drew02a02deep02breath―but02his02dream02seemed02
strangely02to02persist:02his02door02was02flung02open02and02a02man02
whom02he02had02never02seen02stood02in02the02doorway02watching02
him02intently.0202
Raskolnikov02had02hardly02opened02his02eyes02and02he02
instantly02closed02them02again.02He02lay02on02his02back02without02
stirring.0202
"Is02it02still02a02dream?"02he02wondered02and02again02raised02his02
eyelids02hardly02perceptibly;02the02stranger02was02standing02in02
the02same02place,02still02watching02him.0202
He02stepped02cautiously02into02the02room,02carefully02closing02
the02door02after02him,02went02up02to02the02table,02paused02a02moment,02
still02keeping02his02eyes02on02Raskolnikov,02and02noiselessly02
seated02himself02on02the02chair02by02the02sofa;02he02put02his02hat02on02
the02floor02beside02him02and02leaned02his02hands02on02his02cane02and02
his02chin02on02his02hands.02It02was02evident02that02he02was02prepared02
to02wait02indefinitely.02As02far02as02Raskolnikov02could02make02out02
from02his02stolen02glances,02he02was02a02man02no02longer02young,02
stout,02with02a02full,02fair,02almost02whitish02beard.0202
Ten02minutes02passed.02It02was02still02light,02but02beginning02to02
get02dusk.02There02was02complete02stillness02in02the02room.02Not02a02
sound02came02from02the02stairs.02Only02a02big02fly02buzzed02and02
fluttered02against02the02window02pane.02It02was02unbearable02at02
last.02Raskolnikov02suddenly02got02up02and02sat02on02the02sofa.0202
"Come,02tell02me02what02you02want."0202
"I02knew02you02were02not02asleep,02but02only02pretending,"02the02
stranger02 answered02 oddly,02
laughing02 calmly.02 "Arkady02
Ivanovitch02Svidriga07lov,02allow02me02to02introduce02myself...."0202

CHAPTER02I0202
THOUGHT02ONCE02MORE.0202
"CAN02THIS02BE02STILL02A02DREAM?"02RASKOLNIKOV02
He02looked02carefully02and02suspiciously02at02the02unexpected02
visitor.0202
"Svidriga07lov!02What02nonsense!02It02can't02be!"02he02said02at02
last02aloud02in02bewilderment.0202
His02visitor02did02not02seem02at02all02surprised02at02this02
exclamation.0202
"I've02come02to02you02for02two02reasons.02In02the02first02place,02I02
wanted02to02make02your02personal02acquaintance,02as02I02have02
already02heard02a02great02deal02about02you02that02is02interesting02
and02flattering;02secondly,02I02cherish02the02hope02that02you02may02
not02refuse02to02assist02me02in02a02matter02directly02concerning02the02
welfare02of02your02sister,02Avdotya02Romanovna.02For02without02
your02support02she02might02not02let02me02come02near02her02now,02for02
she02is02prejudiced02against02me,02but02with02your02assistance02I02
reckon02on..."0202
"You02reckon02wrongly,"02interrupted02Raskolnikov.0202
"They02only02arrived02yesterday,02may02I02ask02you?"0202
Raskolnikov02made02no02reply.0202
"It02was02yesterday,02I02know.02I02only02arrived02myself02the02day02
before.02Well,02let02me02tell02you02this,02Rodion02Romanovitch,02I02
don't02consider02it02necessary02to02justify02myself,02but02kindly02tell02
me02what02was02there02particularly02criminal02on02my02part02in02all02
this02business,02speaking02without02prejudice,02with02common02
sense?"0202
Raskolnikov02continued02to02look02at02him02in02silence.0202
"That02in02my02own02house02I02persecuted02a02defenceless02girl02
and02'insulted02her02with02my02infamous02proposals'―is02that02it?02
(I02am02anticipating02you.)02But02you've02only02to02assume02that02I,02
too,02am02a02man02 et02 nihil02 humanum...02in02a02word,02that02I02am02
capable02of02being02attracted02and02falling02in02love02(which02does02
not02depend02on02our02will),02then02everything02can02be02explained02
in02the02most02natural02manner.02The02question02is,02am02I02a02
monster,02or02am02I02myself02a02victim?02And02what02if02I02am02a02
victim?02In02proposing02to02the02object02of02my02passion02to02elope02
with02me02to02America02or02Switzerland,02I02may02have02cherished02
the02deepest02respect02for02her02and02may02have02thought02that02I02
was02promoting02our02mutual02happiness!02Reason02is02the02slave02
of02passion,02you02know;02why,02probably,02I02was02doing02more02
harm02to02myself02than02anyone!"0202
"But02that's02not02the02point,"02Raskolnikov02interrupted02with02
disgust.02"It's02simply02that02whether02you02are02right02or02wrong,02
we02dislike02you.02We02don't02want02to02have02anything02to02do02with02
you.02We02show02you02the02door.02Go02out!"0202
Svidriga07lov02broke02into02a02sudden02laugh.0202
"But02you're...02but02there's02no02getting02round02you,"02he02said,02
laughing02in02the02frankest02way.02"I02hoped02to02get02round02you,02
but02you02took02up02the02right02line02at02once!"0202
"But02you02are02trying02to02get02round02me02still!"0202
"What02of02it?02What02of02it?"02cried02Svidriga07lov,02laughing02
openly.02"But02this02is02what02the02French02call02bonne02guerre,02and02
the02most02innocent02form02of02deception!...02But02still02you02have02
interrupted02me;02one02way02or02another,02I02repeat02again:02there02
would02never02have02been02any02unpleasantness02except02for02
what02happened02in02the02garden.02Marfa02Petrovna..."0202
"You02have02got02rid02of02Marfa02Petrovna,02too,02so02they02say?"02
Raskolnikov02interrupted02rudely.0202
"Oh,02you've02heard02that,02too,02then?02You'd02be02sure02to,02
though....02But02as02for02your02question,02I02really02don't02know02
what02to02say,02though02my02own02conscience02is02quite02at02rest02on02
that02score.02Don't02suppose02that02I02am02in02any02apprehension02
about02it.02All02was02regular02and02in02order;02the02medical02inquiry02
diagnosed02apoplexy02due02to02bathing02immediately02after02a02
heavy02dinner02and02a02bottle02of02wine,02and02indeed02it02could02
have02proved02nothing02else.02But02I'll02tell02you02what02I02have02been02
thinking02to02myself02of02late,02on02my02way02here02in02the02train,02
especially:02didn't02I02contribute02to02all02that...02calamity,02
morally,02in02a02way,02by02irritation02or02something02of02the02sort.02
But02I02came02to02the02conclusion02that02that,02too,02was02quite02out02of02
the02question."0202
Raskolnikov02laughed.0202
"I02wonder02you02trouble02yourself02about02it!"0202
"But02what02are02you02laughing02at?02Only02consider,02I02struck02
her02just02twice02with02a02switch―there02were02no02marks02even...02
don't02regard02me02as02a02cynic,02please;02I02am02perfectly02aware02
how02atrocious02it02was02of02me02and02all02that;02but02I02know02for02
certain,02too,02that02Marfa02Petrovna02was02very02likely02pleased02at02
my,02so02to02say,02warmth.02The02story02of02your02sister02had02been02
wrung02out02to02the02last02drop;02for02the02last02three02days02Marfa02
Petrovna02had02been02forced02to02sit02at02home;02she02had02nothing02
to02show02herself02with02in02the02town.02Besides,02she02had02bored02
them02so02with02that02letter02(you02heard02about02her02reading02the02
letter).02And02all02of02a02sudden02those02two02switches02fell02from02
heaven!02Her02first02act02was02to02order02the02carriage02to02be02got02
out....02Not02to02speak02of02the02fact02that02there02are02cases02when02
women02are02very,02very02glad02to02be02insulted02in02spite02of02all02
their02show02of02indignation.02There02are02instances02of02it02with02
everyone;02human02beings02in02general,02indeed,02greatly02love02to02
be02insulted,02have02you02noticed02that?02But02it's02particularly02so02
with02 women.02 One02 might02 even02 say02
it's02 their02 only02
amusement."0202
At02one02time02Raskolnikov02thought02of02getting02up02and02
walking02out02and02so02finishing02the02interview.02But02some02
curiosity02and02even02a02sort02of02prudence02made02him02linger02for02
a02moment.0202
"You02are02fond02of02fighting?"02he02asked02carelessly.0202
"No,02not02very,"02Svidriga07lov02answered,02calmly.02"And02
Marfa02Petrovna02and02I02scarcely02ever02fought.02We02lived02very02
harmoniously,02and02she02was02always02pleased02with02me.02I02only02
used02the02whip02twice02in02all02our02seven02years02(not02counting02a02
third02occasion02of02a02very02ambiguous02character).02The02first02
time,02two02months02after02our02marriage,02immediately02after02
we02arrived02in02the02country,02and02the02last02time02was02that02of02
which02we02are02speaking.02Did02you02suppose02I02was02such02a02
monster,02such02a02reactionary,02such02a02slave02driver?02Ha,02ha!02
By02the02way,02do02you02remember,02Rodion02Romanovitch,02how02
a02few02years02ago,02in02those02days02of02beneficent02publicity,02a02
nobleman,02I've02forgotten02his02name,02was02put02to02shame02
everywhere,02in02all02the02papers,02for02having02thrashed02a02
German02woman02in02the02railway02train.02You02remember?02It02
was02in02those02days,02that02very02year02I02believe,02the02'disgraceful02
action02of02the02 Age'02took02place02(you02know,02'The02Egyptian02
Nights,'02that02public02reading,02you02remember?02The02dark02
eyes,02you02know!02Ah,02the02golden02days02of02our02youth,02where02
are02they?).02Well,02as02for02the02gentleman02who02thrashed02the02
German,02I02feel02no02sympathy02with02him,02because02after02all02
what02need02is02there02for02sympathy?02But02I02must02say02that02there02
are02sometimes02such02provoking02'Germans'02that02I02don't02
believe02there02is02a02progressive02who02could02quite02answer02for02
himself.02No02one02looked02at02the02subject02from02that02point02of02
view02then,02but02that's02the02truly02humane02point02of02view,02I02
assure02you."0202
After02saying02this,02Svidriga07lov02broke02into02a02sudden02
laugh02again.02Raskolnikov02saw02clearly02that02this02was02a02man02
with02a02firm02purpose02in02his02mind02and02able02to02keep02it02to02
himself.0202
"I02expect02you've02not02talked02to02anyone02for02some02days?"02
he02asked.0202
"Scarcely02anyone.02I02suppose02you02are02wondering02at02my02
being02such02an02adaptable02man?"0202
"No,02I02am02only02wondering02at02your02being02too02adaptable02a02
man."0202
"Because02I02am02not02offended02at02the02rudeness02of02your02
questions?02Is02that02it?02But02why02take02offence?02As02you02asked,02

"What02does02he02mean?02Is02he02in02earnest?"02Raskolnikov02
wondered.0202
"No,02the02document02didn't02restrain02me,"02Svidriga07lov02
went02on,02meditatively.02"It02was02my02own02doing,02not02leaving02

"Do02you02see02them,02then?"0202

"Marfa02Petrovna02is02pleased02to02visit02me,"02he02said,02

"What02made02me02think02that02something02of02the02sort02must02

"What!02Did02you02think02so?"02Svidriga07lov02asked02in02
astonishment.02"Did02you02really?02Didn't02I02say02that02there02was02
something02in02common02between02us,02eh?"0202
"You02never02said02so!"02Raskolnikov02cried02sharply02and02
with02heat.0202
"Didn't02I?"0202
"No!"0202
"I02thought02I02did.02When02I02came02in02and02saw02you02lying02with02

muttered02ingenuously,02as02though02he,02too,02were02puzzled.0202
For02a02minute02they02were02silent.02They02stared02in02each02
other's02faces.0202
"That's02 all02 nonsense!"02 Raskolnikov02 shouted02 with02
vexation.02"What02does02she02say02when02she02comes02to02you?"0202
"She!02Would02you02believe02it,02she02talks02of02the02silliest02

"But02perhaps02you02are02telling02lies?"02Raskolnikov02put02in.0202
"I02 rarely02

apparently02not02noticing02the02rudeness02of02the02question.0202
"And02in02the02past,02have02you02ever02seen02ghosts02before?"0202
"Y\yes,02I02have02seen02them,02but02only02once02in02my02life,02six02

"Nothing02of02the02sort,"02Raskolnikov02insisted02irritably.0202

"Can02it02be02you02can02imagine02nothing02juster02and02more02

answered02Svidriga07lov,02with02a02vague02smile.0202
This02 horrible02 answer02 sent02 a02 cold02 chill02 through02
Raskolnikov.02Svidriga07lov02raised02his02head,02looked02at02him,02
and02suddenly02began02laughing.0202
"Only02think,"02he02cried,02"half02an02hour02ago02we02had02never02

Don't02be02angry,02Rodion02Romanovitch,02think02it02over02coolly02
and02quietly."0202
Svidriga07lov02himself02was02exceedingly02cool02and02quiet02as02
he02was02saying02this.0202
"I02beg02you02to02say02no02more,"02said02Raskolnikov.02"In02any02
case02this02is02unpardonable02impertinence."0202
"Not02in02the02least.02Then02a02man02may02do02nothing02but02harm02

"I'm02sorry.02But02you02don't02know02me.02Perhaps02we02may02
become02better02friends."0202
"You02think02we02may02become02friends?"0202
"And02why02not?"02Svidriga07lov02said,02smiling.02He02stood02up02
and02took02his02hat.02"I02didn't02quite02intend02to02disturb02you02and02I02

"Where02did02you02see02me02this02morning?"02Raskolnikov02

"Oh,02all02right.02Are02you02starting02soon02on02your02travels,02
may02I02ask?"0202
"What02travels?"0202
"Why,02on02that02'journey';02you02spoke02of02it02yourself."0202
"A02journey?02Oh,02yes.02I02did02speak02of02a02journey.02Well,02
that's02a02wide02subject....02if02only02you02knew02what02you02are02

"Perhaps02I'll02get02married02instead02of02the02journey.02They're02
making02a02match02for02me."0202
"Here?"0202
"Yes."0202
"How02have02you02had02time02for02that?"0202
"But02I02am02very02anxious02to02see02Avdotya02Romanovna02
once.02I02earnestly02beg02it.02Well,02good\bye02for02the02present.02Oh,02

Romanovitch,02that02Marfa02Petrovna02remembered02her02in02her02
will02and02left02her02three02thousand02roubles.02That's02absolutely02
certain.02Marfa02Petrovna02arranged02it02a02week02before02her02

in02 my02 presence.02 Avdotya02
it02 was02 done02
Romanovna02will02be02able02to02receive02the02money02in02two02or02
three02weeks."0202
"Are02you02telling02the02truth?"0202
"Yes,02tell02her.02Well,02your02servant.02I02am02staying02very02near02
you."0202As02he02went02out,02Svidriga07lov02ran02up02against02Razumihin02
in02the02doorway.0202
02
02
CHAPTER02II0202
It02was02nearly02eight02o'clock.02The02two02young02men02hurried02
to02Bakaleyev's,02to02arrive02before02Luzhin.0202
"Why,02who02was02that?"02asked02Razumihin,02as02soon02as02they02
were02in02the02street.0202
"It02was02Svidriga07lov,02that02landowner02in02whose02house02my02
sister02was02insulted02when02she02was02their02governess.02
Through02his02persecuting02her02with02his02attentions,02she02was02
turned02out02by02his02wife,02Marfa02Petrovna.02This02Marfa02
Petrovna02begged02Dounia's02forgiveness02afterwards,02and02
she's02just02died02suddenly.02It02was02of02her02we02were02talking02this02
morning.02I02don't02know02why02I'm02afraid02of02that02man.02He02came02
here02at02once02after02his02wife's02funeral.02He02is02very02strange,02
and02is02determined02on02doing02something....02We02must02guard02
Dounia02from02him...02that's02what02I02wanted02to02tell02you,02do02you02
hear?"0202
"Guard02 her!02 What02 can02 he02 do02 to02 harm02 Avdotya02
Romanovna?02Thank02you,02Rodya,02for02speaking02to02me02like02
that....02We02will,02we02will02guard02her.02Where02does02he02live?"0202
"I02don't02know."0202
"Why02didn't02you02ask?02What02a02pity!02I'll02find02out,02though."0202
"Did02you02see02him?"02asked02Raskolnikov02after02a02pause.0202
"Yes,02I02noticed02him,02I02noticed02him02well."0202
"You02did02really02see02him?02You02saw02him02clearly?"02
Raskolnikov02insisted.0202
"Yes,02I02remember02him02perfectly,02I02should02know02him02in02a02
thousand;02I02have02a02good02memory02for02faces."0202
They02were02silent02again.0202
"Hm!...02that's02all02right,"02muttered02Raskolnikov.02"Do02you02
know,02I02fancied...02I02keep02thinking02that02it02may02have02been02an02
hallucination."0202
"What02do02you02mean?02I02don't02understand02you."0202
"Well,02you02all02say,"02Raskolnikov02went02on,02twisting02his02
mouth02into02a02smile,02"that02I02am02mad.02I02thought02just02now02that02
perhaps02I02really02am02mad,02and02have02only02seen02a02phantom."0202
"What02do02you02mean?"0202
"Why,02who02can02tell?02Perhaps02I02am02really02mad,02and02
perhaps02everything02that02happened02all02these02days02may02be02
only02imagination."0202
"Ach,02Rodya,02you02have02been02upset02again!...02But02what02did02
he02say,02what02did02he02come02for?"0202
Raskolnikov02did02not02answer.02Razumihin02thought02a02
minute.0202
"Now02let02me02tell02you02my02story,"02he02began,02"I02came02to02
you,02you02were02asleep.02Then02we02had02dinner02and02then02I02went02
to02Porfiry's,02Zametov02was02still02with02him.02I02tried02to02begin,02
but02it02was02no02use.02I02couldn't02speak02in02the02right02way.02They02
don't02seem02to02understand02and02can't02understand,02but02are02
not02a02bit02ashamed.02I02drew02Porfiry02to02the02window,02and02
began02talking02to02him,02but02it02was02still02no02use.02He02looked02
away02and02I02looked02away.02At02last02I02shook02my02fist02in02his02ugly02

very02stupid.02To02Zametov02I02didn't02say02a02word.02But,02you02see,02I02
thought02I'd02made02a02mess02of02it,02but02as02I02went02downstairs02a02

care?02You02needn't02care02a02hang02for02them.02We02shall02have02a02

but02let's02laugh02at02them02now!"0202
"To02be02sure,"02answered02Raskolnikov.02"But02what02will02you02
say02to\morrow?"02he02thought02to02himself.02Strange02to02say,02till02
that02moment02it02had02never02occurred02to02him02to02wonder02what02
Razumihin02would02think02when02he02knew.02As02he02thought02it,02
Raskolnikov02looked02at02him.02Razumihin's02account02of02his02
visit02to02Porfiry02had02very02little02interest02for02him,02so02much02had02
come02and02gone02since02then.0202
In02the02corridor02they02came02upon02Luzhin;02he02had02arrived02
punctually02at02eight,02and02was02looking02for02the02number,02so02
that02all02three02went02in02together02without02greeting02or02looking02
at02one02another.02The02young02men02walked02in02first,02while02Pyotr02
Petrovitch,02for02good02manners,02lingered02a02little02in02the02
passage,02taking02off02his02coat.02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02came02
forward02at02once02to02greet02him02in02the02doorway,02Dounia02was02
welcoming02her02brother.02Pyotr02Petrovitch02walked02in02and02
quite02amiably,02though02with02redoubled02dignity,02bowed02to02
the02ladies.02He02looked,02however,02as02though02he02were02a02little02
put02out02and02could02not02yet02recover02himself.02Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna,02who02seemed02also02a02little02embarrassed,02
hastened02to02make02them02all02sit02down02at02the02round02table02
where02a02samovar02was02boiling.02Dounia02and02Luzhin02were02
facing02one02another02on02opposite02sides02of02the02table.02
facing02 Pulcheria02
Razumihin02 and02 Raskolnikov02 were02
Alexandrovna,02 Razumihin02 was02 next02 to02 Luzhin02 and02
Raskolnikov02was02beside02his02sister.0202
A02 moment's02 silence02
followed.02 Pyotr02 Petrovitch02
deliberately02drew02out02a02cambric02handkerchief02reeking02of02
scent02and02blew02his02nose02with02an02air02of02a02benevolent02man02
who02felt02himself02slighted,02and02was02firmly02resolved02to02insist02
on02an02explanation.02In02the02passage02the02idea02had02occurred02to02
him02to02keep02on02his02overcoat02and02walk02away,02and02so02give02
the02two02ladies02a02sharp02and02emphatic02lesson02and02make02
them02feel02the02gravity02of02the02position.02But02he02could02not02
bring02himself02to02do02this.02Besides,02he02could02not02endure02
uncertainty,02and02he02wanted02an02explanation:02if02his02request02
had02been02so02openly02disobeyed,02there02was02something02
behind02it,02and02in02that02case02it02was02better02to02find02it02out02
beforehand;02it02rested02with02him02to02punish02them02and02there02
would02always02be02time02for02that.0202
"I02trust02you02had02a02favourable02journey,"02he02inquired02
officially02of02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna.0202
"Oh,02very,02Pyotr02Petrovitch."0202
"I02am02gratified02to02hear02it.02And02Avdotya02Romanovna02is02
not02over\fatigued02either?"0202
"I02am02young02and02strong,02I02don't02get02tired,02but02it02was02a02
great02strain02for02mother,"02answered02Dounia.0202
"That's02unavoidable!02our02national02railways02are02of02
terrible02length.02'Mother02Russia,'02as02they02say,02is02a02vast02
country....02In02spite02of02all02my02desire02to02do02so,02I02was02unable02to02
meet02you02yesterday.02But02I02trust02all02passed02off02without02
inconvenience?"0202
terribly02
it02 was02 all02
"Oh,02 no,02 Pyotr02 Petrovitch,02
disheartening,"02 Pulcheria02 Alexandrovna02 hastened02
to02
declare02with02peculiar02intonation,02"and02if02Dmitri02Prokofitch02
had02not02been02sent02us,02I02really02believe02by02God02Himself,02we02
is!02 Dmitri02
lost.02 Here,02 he02
should02 have02 been02 utterly02
Prokofitch02Razumihin,"02she02added,02introducing02him02to02
Luzhin.0202
"I02had02the02pleasure...02yesterday,"02muttered02Pyotr02
Petrovitch02with02a02hostile02glance02sidelong02at02Razumihin;02
then02he02scowled02and02was02silent.0202
Pyotr02Petrovitch02belonged02to02that02class02of02persons,02on02
the02surface02very02polite02in02society,02who02make02a02great02point02
of02punctiliousness,02but02who,02directly02they02are02crossed02in02
anything,02are02completely02disconcerted,02and02become02more02
like02sacks02of02flour02than02elegant02and02lively02men02of02society.02
Again02all02was02silent;02Raskolnikov02was02obstinately02mute,02
Avdotya02 Romanovna02 was02 unwilling02
to02 open02
the02
conversation02too02soon.02Razumihin02had02nothing02to02say,02so02
Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02was02anxious02again.0202
"Marfa02Petrovna02is02dead,02have02you02heard?"02she02began02
having02recourse02to02her02leading02item02of02conversation.0202
"To02be02sure,02I02heard02so.02I02was02immediately02informed,02
and02I02have02come02to02make02you02acquainted02with02the02fact02that02
Arkady02 Ivanovitch02 Svidriga07lov02 set02 off02
in02 haste02 for02
Petersburg02immediately02after02his02wife's02funeral.02So02at02least02
I02have02excellent02authority02for02believing."0202
"To02Petersburg?02here?"02Dounia02asked02in02alarm02and02
looked02at02her02mother.0202
"Yes,02indeed,02and02doubtless02not02without02some02design,02
having02in02view02the02rapidity02of02his02departure,02and02all02the02
circumstances02preceding02it."0202
"Good02heavens!02won't02he02leave02Dounia02in02peace02even02
here?"02cried02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna.0202
"I02imagine02that02neither02you02nor02Avdotya02Romanovna02
have02any02grounds02for02uneasiness,02unless,02of02course,02you02
are02yourselves02desirous02of02getting02into02communication02
with02him.02For02my02part02I02am02on02my02guard,02and02am02now02
discovering02where02he02is02lodging."0202
"Oh,02Pyotr02Petrovitch,02you02would02not02believe02what02a02
fright02you02have02given02me,"02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02went02
on:02"I've02only02seen02him02twice,02but02I02thought02him02terrible,02
terrible!02I02am02convinced02that02he02was02the02cause02of02Marfa02
Petrovna's02death."0202
"It's02impossible02to02be02certain02about02that.02I02have02precise02

to02accelerate02the02course02of02events02by02the02moral02influence,02

with02you.02I02do02not02know02whether02he02is02well02off02now,02and02
precisely02what02Marfa02Petrovna02left02him;02this02will02be02known02
to02me02within02a02very02short02period;02but02no02doubt02here02in02
Petersburg,02if02he02has02any02pecuniary02resources,02he02will02
relapse02at02once02into02his02old02ways.02He02is02the02most02depraved,02
and02abjectly02vicious02specimen02of02that02class02of02men.02I02have02
considerable02reason02to02believe02that02Marfa02Petrovna,02who02
was02so02unfortunate02as02to02fall02in02love02with02him02and02to02pay02
his02debts02eight02years02ago,02was02of02service02to02him02also02in02
another02way.02Solely02by02her02exertions02and02sacrifices,02a02
criminal02charge,02involving02an02element02of02fantastic02and02
homicidal02brutality02for02which02he02might02well02have02been02
sentenced02to02Siberia,02was02hushed02up.02That's02the02sort02of02
man02he02is,02if02you02care02to02know."0202
"Good02 heavens!"02
cried02 Pulcheria02 Alexandrovna.02
Raskolnikov02listened02attentively.0202
"Are02you02speaking02the02truth02when02you02say02that02you02
have02good02evidence02of02this?"02Dounia02asked02sternly02and02
emphatically.0202
"I02only02repeat02what02I02was02told02in02secret02by02Marfa02
Petrovna.02I02must02observe02that02from02the02legal02point02of02view02
the02case02was02far02from02clear.02There02was,02and02I02believe02still02
is,02living02here02a02woman02called02Resslich,02a02foreigner,02who02
lent02small02sums02of02money02at02interest,02and02did02other02
commissions,02and02with02this02woman02Svidriga07lov02had02for02a02
long02while02close02and02mysterious02relations.02She02had02a02
relation,02a02niece02I02believe,02living02with02her,02a02deaf02and02dumb02
girl02of02fifteen,02or02perhaps02not02more02than02fourteen.02Resslich02
hated02this02girl,02and02grudged02her02every02crust;02she02used02to02
beat02her02mercilessly.02One02day02the02girl02was02found02hanging02
in02the02garret.02At02the02inquest02the02verdict02was02suicide.02After02
the02usual02proceedings02the02matter02ended,02but,02later02on,02
information02was02given02that02the02child02had02been...02cruelly02
outraged02by02Svidriga07lov.02It02is02true,02this02was02not02clearly02
established,02the02information02was02given02by02another02German02
woman02of02loose02character02whose02word02could02not02be02
trusted;02no02statement02was02actually02made02to02the02police,02
thanks02to02Marfa02Petrovna's02money02and02exertions;02it02did02not02
get02beyond02gossip.02And02yet02the02story02is02a02very02significant02
one.02You02heard,02no02doubt,02Avdotya02Romanovna,02when02you02
were02with02them02the02story02of02the02servant02Philip02who02died02of02
ill02treatment02he02received02six02years02ago,02before02the02abolition02
of02serfdom."0202
"I02heard,02on02the02contrary,02that02this02Philip02hanged02
himself."0202
"Quite02so,02but02what02drove02him,02or02rather02perhaps02
disposed02him,02to02suicide02was02the02systematic02persecution02
and02severity02of02Mr.02Svidriga07lov."0202
"I02don't02know02that,"02answered02Dounia,02dryly.02"I02only02
heard02 a02 queer02 story02
that02 Philip02 was02 a02 sort02 of02
hypochondriac,02 a02 sort02 of02 domestic02 philosopher,02 the02
servants02used02to02say,02'he02read02himself02silly,'02and02that02he02
hanged02himself02partly02on02account02of02Mr.02Svidriga07lov's02
mockery02of02him02and02not02his02blows.02When02I02was02there02he02
behaved02well02to02the02servants,02and02they02were02actually02fond02
of02him,02though02they02certainly02did02blame02him02for02Philip's02
death."0202
"I02 perceive,02 Avdotya02 Romanovna,02 that02 you02 seem02
disposed02to02undertake02his02defence02all02of02a02sudden,"02Luzhin02
observed,02twisting02his02lips02into02an02ambiguous02smile,02
"there's02no02doubt02that02he02is02an02astute02man,02and02insinuating02
where02ladies02are02concerned,02of02which02Marfa02Petrovna,02who02
has02died02so02strangely,02is02a02terrible02instance.02My02only02desire02
has02been02to02be02of02service02to02you02and02your02mother02with02my02
advice,02in02view02of02the02renewed02efforts02which02may02certainly02
be02anticipated02from02him.02For02my02part02it's02my02firm02
conviction,02that02he02will02end02in02a02debtor's02prison02again.02
Marfa02Petrovna02had02not02the02slightest02intention02of02settling02
anything02substantial02on02him,02having02regard02for02his02
children's02interests,02and,02if02she02left02him02anything,02it02would02
only02be02the02merest02sufficiency,02something02insignificant02and02
ephemeral,02which02would02not02last02a02year02for02a02man02of02his02
habits."0202
"Pyotr02Petrovitch,02I02beg02you,"02said02Dounia,02"say02no02more02
of02Mr.02Svidriga07lov.02It02makes02me02miserable."0202
"He02has02just02been02to02see02me,"02said02Raskolnikov,02
breaking02his02silence02for02the02first02time.0202
There02were02exclamations02from02all,02and02they02all02turned02
to02him.02Even02Pyotr02Petrovitch02was02roused.0202
"An02hour02and02a02half02ago,02he02came02in02when02I02was02asleep,02
waked02 me,02 and02
introduced02 himself,"02 Raskolnikov02
continued.02"He02was02fairly02cheerful02and02at02ease,02and02quite02
hopes02that02we02shall02become02friends.02He02is02particularly02
anxious,02by02the02way,02Dounia,02for02an02interview02with02you,02at02
which02he02asked02me02to02assist.02He02has02a02proposition02to02make02
to02you,02and02he02told02me02about02it.02He02told02me,02too,02that02a02
week02before02her02death02Marfa02Petrovna02left02you02three02
thousand02roubles02in02her02will,02Dounia,02and02that02you02can02
receive02the02money02very02shortly."0202
"Thank02God!"02cried02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna,02crossing02
herself.02"Pray02for02her02soul,02Dounia!"0202
"It's02a02fact!"02broke02from02Luzhin.0202
"Tell02us,02what02more?"02Dounia02urged02Raskolnikov.0202
"Then02he02said02that02he02wasn't02rich02and02all02the02estate02was02
left02to02his02children02who02are02now02with02an02aunt,02then02that02he02
was02staying02somewhere02not02far02from02me,02but02where,02I02
don't02know,02I02didn't02ask...."0202
"But02what,02what02does02he02want02to02propose02to02Dounia?"02
cried02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02in02a02fright.02"Did02he02tell02you?"0202
"Yes."0202
"What02was02it?"0202
"I'll02tell02you02afterwards."0202
Raskolnikov02ceased02speaking02and02turned02his02attention02
to02his02tea.0202
Pyotr02Petrovitch02looked02at02his02watch.0202
"I02am02compelled02to02keep02a02business02engagement,02and02so02
I02shall02not02be02in02your02way,"02he02added02with02an02air02of02some02
pique02and02he02began02getting02up.0202
"Don't02go,02Pyotr02Petrovitch,"02said02Dounia,02"you02intended02
to02spend02the02evening.02Besides,02you02wrote02yourself02that02you02
wanted02to02have02an02explanation02with02mother."0202
"Precisely02so,02Avdotya02Romanovna,"02Pyotr02Petrovitch02
answered02impressively,02sitting02down02again,02but02still02
holding02his02hat.02"I02certainly02desired02an02explanation02with02
you02and02your02honoured02mother02upon02a02very02important02
point02indeed.02But02as02your02brother02cannot02speak02openly02in02
my02presence02of02some02proposals02of02Mr.02Svidriga07lov,02I,02too,02
do02not02desire02and02am02not02able02to02speak02openly...02in02the02
presence02of02others...02of02certain02matters02of02the02greatest02
gravity.02Moreover,02my02most02weighty02and02urgent02request02
has02been02disregarded...."0202
Assuming02an02aggrieved02air,02Luzhin02relapsed02into02
dignified02silence.0202
"Your02request02that02my02brother02should02not02be02present02at02
our02meeting02was02disregarded02solely02at02my02instance,"02said02
Dounia.02"You02wrote02that02you02had02been02insulted02by02my02
brother;02I02think02that02this02must02be02explained02at02once,02and02
you02must02be02reconciled.02And02if02Rodya02really02has02insulted02
you,02then02he02should02and02will02apologise."0202
Pyotr02Petrovitch02took02a02stronger02line.0202
"There02are02insults,02Avdotya02Romanovna,02which02no02
goodwill02can02make02us02forget.02There02is02a02line02in02everything02
which02it02is02dangerous02to02overstep;02and02when02it02has02been02
overstepped,02there02is02no02return."0202
"That02wasn't02what02I02was02speaking02of02exactly,02Pyotr02
Petrovitch,"02Dounia02interrupted02with02some02impatience.02
"Please02understand02that02our02whole02future02depends02now02on02
whether02all02this02is02explained02and02set02right02as02soon02as02
possible.02I02tell02you02frankly02at02the02start02that02I02cannot02look02at02
it02in02any02other02light,02and02if02you02have02the02least02regard02for02
me,02all02this02business02must02be02ended02to\day,02however02hard02
that02may02be.02I02repeat02that02if02my02brother02is02to02blame02he02will02
ask02your02forgiveness."0202

CHAPTER02III0202
The02fact02was02that02up02to02the02last02moment02he02had02never02
expected02such02an02ending;02he02had02been02overbearing02to02the02
last02degree,02never02dreaming02that02two02destitute02and02
defenceless02women02could02escape02from02his02control.02This02
conviction02was02strengthened02by02his02vanity02and02conceit,02a02
conceit02to02the02point02of02fatuity.02Pyotr02Petrovitch,02who02had02
made02his02way02up02from02insignificance,02was02morbidly02given02
to02 self\admiration,02 had02 the02 highest02 opinion02 of02 his02
intelligence02and02capacities,02and02sometimes02even02gloated02in02
solitude02over02his02image02in02the02glass.02But02what02he02loved02and02
valued02above02all02was02the02money02he02had02amassed02by02his02
labour,02and02by02all02sorts02of02devices:02that02money02made02him02
the02equal02of02all02who02had02been02his02superiors.0202
When02he02had02bitterly02reminded02Dounia02that02he02had02

genuinely02indignant02at02such02"black02ingratitude."02And02yet,02
when02he02made02Dounia02his02offer,02he02was02fully02aware02of02the02
groundlessness02of02all02the02gossip.02The02story02had02been02
everywhere02contradicted02by02Marfa02Petrovna,02and02was02by02
then02disbelieved02by02all02the02townspeople,02who02were02warm02
in02Dounia'a02defence.02And02he02would02not02have02denied02that02he02
knew02all02that02at02the02time.02Yet02he02still02thought02highly02of02his02
own02resolution02in02lifting02Dounia02to02his02level02and02regarded02
it02as02something02heroic.02In02speaking02of02it02to02Dounia,02he02had02
let02out02the02secret02feeling02he02cherished02and02admired,02and02he02

too.02He02had02called02on02Raskolnikov02with02the02feelings02of02a02
benefactor02who02is02about02to02reap02the02fruits02of02his02good02
deeds02and02to02hear02agreeable02flattery.02And02as02he02went02
he02
now,02
downstairs02
considered02
himself02 most02
undeservedly02injured02and02unrecognised.0202
Dounia02was02simply02essential02to02him;02to02do02without02her02
was02unthinkable.02For02many02years02he02had02had02voluptuous02
dreams02of02marriage,02but02he02had02gone02on02waiting02and02
amassing02money.02He02brooded02with02relish,02in02profound02
secret,02over02the02image02of02a02girl―virtuous,02poor02(she02must02
be02poor),02very02young,02very02pretty,02of02good02birth02and02
education,02very02timid,02one02who02had02suffered02much,02and02
was02completely02humbled02before02him,02one02who02would02all02
her02life02look02on02him02as02her02saviour,02worship02him,02admire02
him02and02only02him.02How02many02scenes,02how02many02amorous02
episodes02he02had02imagined02on02this02seductive02and02playful02
theme,02when02his02work02was02over!02And,02behold,02the02dream02of02
so02many02years02was02all02but02realised;02the02beauty02and02
education02of02Avdotya02Romanovna02had02impressed02him;02her02
helpless02position02had02been02a02great02allurement;02in02her02he02
had02found02even02more02than02he02dreamed02of.02Here02was02a02girl02
of02pride,02character,02virtue,02of02education02and02breeding02
superior02to02his02own02(he02felt02that),02and02this02creature02would02
for02 his02 heroic02
be02 slavishly02 grateful02 all02 her02
condescension,02and02would02humble02herself02in02the02dust02
before02him,02and02he02would02have02absolute,02unbounded02
power02over02her!...02Not02long02before,02he02had,02too,02after02long02
reflection02and02hesitation,02made02an02important02change02in02his02
career02and02was02now02entering02on02a02wider02circle02of02business.02
With02this02change02his02cherished02dreams02of02rising02into02a02
higher02class02of02society02seemed02likely02to02be02realised....02He02
was,02in02fact,02determined02to02try02his02fortune02in02Petersburg.02
He02knew02that02women02could02do02a02very02great02deal.02The02
fascination02of02a02charming,02virtuous,02highly02educated02
woman02might02make02his02way02easier,02might02do02wonders02in02
attracting02people02to02him,02throwing02an02aureole02round02him,02
life02
and02now02everything02was02in02ruins!02This02sudden02horrible02
rupture02affected02him02like02a02clap02of02thunder;02it02was02like02a02
hideous02joke,02an02absurdity.02He02had02only02been02a02tiny02bit02
masterful,02had02not02even02time02to02speak02out,02had02simply02
made02a02joke,02been02carried02away―and02it02had02ended02so02
seriously.02And,02of02course,02too,02he02did02love02Dounia02in02his02
own02way;02he02already02possessed02her02in02his02dreams―and02all02
at02once!02No!02The02next02day,02the02very02next02day,02it02must02all02be02
set02right,02smoothed02over,02settled.02Above02all02he02must02crush02
that02conceited02milksop02who02was02the02cause02of02it02all.02With02a02
sick02feeling02he02could02not02help02recalling02Razumihin02too,02but,02
he02soon02reassured02himself02on02that02score;02as02though02a02
fellow02like02that02could02be02put02on02a02level02with02him!02The02man02
he02really02dreaded02in02earnest02was02Svidriga07lov....02He02had,02in02
short,02a02great02deal02to02attend02to....0202
"No,02I,02I02am02more02to02blame02than02anyone!"02said02Dounia,02
kissing02and02embracing02her02mother.02"I02was02tempted02by02his02
money,02but02on02my02honour,02brother,02I02had02no02idea02he02was02
such02a02base02man.02If02I02had02seen02through02him02before,02nothing02
would02have02tempted02me!02Don't02blame02me,02brother!"0202
"God02has02delivered02us!02God02has02delivered02us!"02Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna02muttered,02but02half02consciously,02as02though02
scarcely02able02to02realise02what02had02happened.0202
They02were02all02relieved,02and02in02five02minutes02they02were02
laughing.02Only02now02and02then02Dounia02turned02white02and02
frowned,02 remembering02 what02 had02 passed.02 Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna02was02surprised02to02find02that02she,02too,02was02
glad:02she02had02only02that02morning02thought02rupture02with02
Luzhin02a02terrible02misfortune.02Razumihin02was02delighted.02He02
02
did02not02yet02dare02to02express02his02joy02fully,02but02he02was02in02a02
fever02of02excitement02as02though02a02ton\weight02had02fallen02off02
his02heart.02Now02he02had02the02right02to02devote02his02life02to02them,02
to02serve02them....02Anything02might02happen02now!02But02he02felt02
afraid02to02think02of02further02possibilities02and02dared02not02let02his02
imagination02range.02But02Raskolnikov02sat02still02in02the02same02
place,02almost02sullen02and02indifferent.02Though02he02had02been02
the02most02insistent02on02getting02rid02of02Luzhin,02he02seemed02now02
the02least02concerned02at02what02had02happened.02Dounia02could02
not02help02thinking02that02he02was02still02angry02with02her,02and02
Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02watched02him02timidly.0202
"What02did02Svidriga07lov02say02to02you?"02said02Dounia,02
approaching02him.0202
"Yes,02yes!"02cried02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna.0202
Raskolnikov02raised02his02head.0202
"He02wants02to02make02you02a02present02of02ten02thousand02
roubles02and02he02desires02to02see02you02once02in02my02presence."0202
account!"02
"See02 her!02 On02 no02
cried02 Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna.02"And02how02dare02he02offer02her02money!"0202
repeated02
Then02 Raskolnikov02
(rather02 dryly)02 his02
conversation02with02Svidriga07lov,02omitting02his02account02of02the02
ghostly02visitations02of02Marfa02Petrovna,02wishing02to02avoid02all02
unnecessary02talk.0202
"What02answer02did02you02give02him?"02asked02Dounia.0202
"At02first02I02said02I02would02not02take02any02message02to02you.02
Then02he02said02that02he02would02do02his02utmost02to02obtain02an02
interview02with02you02without02my02help.02He02assured02me02that02
his02passion02for02you02was02a02passing02infatuation,02now02he02has02
no02feeling02for02you.02He02doesn't02want02you02to02marry02Luzhin....02
His02talk02was02altogether02rather02muddled."0202
"How02do02you02explain02him02to02yourself,02Rodya?02How02did02
he02strike02you?"0202
"I02must02confess02I02don't02quite02understand02him.02He02offers02
you02ten02thousand,02and02yet02says02he02is02not02well02off.02He02says02
he02is02going02away,02and02in02ten02minutes02he02forgets02he02has02said02
it.02Then02he02says02is02he02going02to02be02married02and02has02already02
fixed02on02the02girl....02No02doubt02he02has02a02motive,02and02probably02
a02bad02one.02But02it's02odd02that02he02should02be02so02clumsy02about02it02
if02he02had02any02designs02against02you....02Of02course,02I02refused02
this02money02on02your02account,02once02for02all.02Altogether,02I02
thought02him02very02strange....02One02might02almost02think02he02was02
mad.02But02I02may02be02mistaken;02that02may02only02be02the02part02he02
assumes.02The02death02of02Marfa02Petrovna02seems02to02have02
made02a02great02impression02on02him."0202
"God02rest02her02soul,"02exclaimed02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna.02
"I02shall02always,02always02pray02for02her!02Where02should02we02be02
now,02Dounia,02without02this02three02thousand!02It's02as02though02it02
had02fallen02from02heaven!02Why,02Rodya,02this02morning02we02had02
only02three02roubles02in02our02pocket02and02Dounia02and02I02were02
just02planning02to02pawn02her02watch,02so02as02to02avoid02borrowing02
from02that02man02until02he02offered02help."0202
Dounia02seemed02strangely02impressed02by02Svidriga07lov's02
offer.02She02still02stood02meditating.0202
"He02has02got02some02terrible02plan,"02she02said02in02a02half02
whisper02to02herself,02almost02shuddering.0202
Raskolnikov02noticed02this02disproportionate02terror.0202
"I02fancy02I02shall02have02to02see02him02more02than02once02again,"02
he02said02to02Dounia.0202
"We02will02watch02him!02I02will02track02him02out!"02cried02
Razumihin,02vigorously.02"I02won't02lose02sight02of02him.02Rodya02
has02given02me02leave.02He02said02to02me02himself02just02now.02'Take02
care02of02my02sister.'02Will02you02give02me02leave,02too,02Avdotya02
Romanovna?"0202
Dounia02smiled02and02held02out02her02hand,02but02the02look02of02
anxiety02did02not02leave02her02face.02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02
gazed02at02her02timidly,02but02the02three02thousand02roubles02had02
obviously02a02soothing02effect02on02her.0202
A02quarter02of02an02hour02later,02they02were02all02engaged02in02a02
lively02conversation.02Even02Raskolnikov02listened02attentively02
for02some02time,02though02he02did02not02talk.02Razumihin02was02the02
speaker.0202
"And02why,02why02should02you02go02away?"02he02flowed02on02
ecstatically.02"And02what02are02you02to02do02in02a02little02town?02The02
great02thing02is,02you02are02all02here02together02and02you02need02one02
another―you02do02need02one02another,02believe02me.02For02a02time,02
anyway....02Take02me02into02partnership,02and02I02assure02you02we'll02
plan02a02capital02enterprise.02Listen!02I'll02explain02it02all02in02detail02
to02you,02the02whole02project!02It02all02flashed02into02my02head02this02
morning,02before02anything02had02happened...02I02tell02you02what;02I02
have02an02uncle,02I02must02introduce02him02to02you02(a02most02
accommodating02and02respectable02old02man).02This02uncle02has02
got02a02capital02of02a02thousand02roubles,02and02he02lives02on02his02
pension02and02has02no02need02of02that02money.02For02the02last02two02
years02he02has02been02bothering02me02to02borrow02it02from02him02and02
pay02him02six02per02cent.02interest.02I02know02what02that02means;02he02
simply02wants02to02help02me.02Last02year02I02had02no02need02of02it,02but02
this02year02I02resolved02to02borrow02it02as02soon02as02he02arrived.02
Then02you02lend02me02another02thousand02of02your02three02and02we02
have02enough02for02a02start,02so02we'll02go02into02partnership,02and02
what02are02we02going02to02do?"0202
Then02Razumihin02began02to02unfold02his02project,02and02he02
explained02at02length02that02almost02all02our02publishers02and02
booksellers02know02nothing02at02all02of02what02they02are02selling,02
and02for02that02reason02they02are02usually02bad02publishers,02and02
that02any02decent02publications02pay02as02a02rule02and02give02a02profit,02
sometimes02a02considerable02one.02Razumihin02had,02indeed,02
been02dreaming02of02setting02up02as02a02publisher.02For02the02last02
two02years02he02had02been02working02in02publishers'02offices,02and02
knew02three02European02languages02well,02though02he02had02told02
Raskolnikov02six02days02before02that02he02was02"schwach"02in02
German02with02an02object02of02persuading02him02to02take02half02his02
translation02and02half02the02payment02for02it.02He02had02told02a02lie02
then,02and02Raskolnikov02knew02he02was02lying.0202
"Why,02why02should02we02let02our02chance02slip02when02we02have02
one02of02the02chief02means02of02success―money02of02our02own!"02
cried02Razumihin02warmly.02"Of02course02there02will02be02a02lot02of02

Rodion....02You02get02a02splendid02profit02on02some02books02
nowadays!02And02the02great02point02of02the02business02is02that02we02
shall02know02just02what02wants02translating,02and02we02shall02be02
translating,02publishing,02learning02all02at02once.02I02can02be02of02use02

three02books02which02one02might02get02a02hundred02roubles02
simply02for02thinking02of02translating02and02publishing.02Indeed,02
and02I02would02not02take02five02hundred02for02the02very02idea02of02one02
of02them.02And02what02do02you02think?02If02I02were02to02tell02a02
publisher,02 I02 dare02 say02 he'd02 hesitate―they02 are02 such02
blockheads!02And02as02for02the02business02side,02printing,02paper,02
selling,02you02trust02to02me,02I02know02my02way02about.02We'll02begin02
in02a02small02way02and02go02on02to02a02large.02In02any02case02it02will02get02

Dounia's02eyes02shone.0202
"I02like02what02you02are02saying,02Dmitri02Prokofitch!"02she02said.0202
"I02know02nothing02about02it,02of02course,"02put02in02Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna,02"it02may02be02a02good02idea,02but02again02God02

here02at02least02for02a02time."02She02looked02at02Rodya.0202
"What02do02you02think,02brother?"02said02Dounia.0202
"I02think02he's02got02a02very02good02idea,"02he02answered.02"Of02
course,02it's02too02soon02to02dream02of02a02publishing02firm,02but02we02

doubt02about02that02either.02He02knows02the02business....02But02we02
can02talk02it02over02later...."0202
"Hurrah!"02cried02Razumihin.02"Now,02stay,02there's02a02flat02
here02in02this02house,02belonging02to02the02same02owner.02It's02a02

"What,02Rodya,02you02are02going02already?"02Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna02asked02in02dismay.0202
"At02such02a02minute?"02cried02Razumihin.0202
Dounia02looked02at02her02brother02with02incredulous02wonder.02

"One02would02think02you02were02burying02me02or02saying02good\

slip02accidentally.02It02was02what02he02was02thinking,02and02it02
somehow02was02uttered02aloud.0202
"What02is02the02matter02with02you?"02cried02his02mother.0202
"Where02are02you02going,02Rodya?"02asked02Dounia02rather02
strangely.0202
"Oh,02I'm02quite02obliged02to..."02he02answered02vaguely,02as02
though02hesitating02what02he02would02say.02But02there02was02a02look02
of02sharp02determination02in02his02white02face.0202
"I02meant02to02say...02as02I02was02coming02here...02I02meant02to02tell02
you,02mother,02and02you,02Dounia,02that02it02would02be02better02for02
us02to02part02for02a02time.02I02feel02ill,02I02am02not02at02peace....02I02will02
come02afterwards,02I02will02come02of02myself...02when02it's02possible.02
I02remember02you02and02love02you....02Leave02me,02leave02me02alone.02
I02decided02this02even02before...02I'm02absolutely02resolved02on02it.02
Whatever02may02come02to02me,02whether02I02come02to02ruin02or02not,02
I02want02to02be02alone.02Forget02me02altogether,02it's02better.02Don't02
inquire02about02me.02When02I02can,02I'll02come02of02myself02or...02I'll02
send02for02you.02Perhaps02it02will02all02come02back,02but02now02if02you02
love02me,02give02me02up...02else02I02shall02begin02to02hate02you,02I02feel02
it....02Good\bye!"0202
"Good02God!"02cried02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna.02Both02his02
mother02and02his02sister02were02terribly02alarmed.02Razumihin02
was02also.0202
"Rodya,02Rodya,02be02reconciled02with02us!02Let02us02be02as02
before!"02cried02his02poor02mother.0202
He02turned02slowly02to02the02door02and02slowly02went02out02of02the02
room.02Dounia02overtook02him.0202
"Brother,02 what02 are02 you02 doing02 to02 mother?"02 she02
whispered,02her02eyes02flashing02with02indignation.0202
He02looked02dully02at02her.0202
"No02matter,02I02shall02come....02I'm02coming,"02he02muttered02in02
an02undertone,02as02though02not02fully02conscious02of02what02he02
was02saying,02and02he02went02out02of02the02room.0202
"Wicked,02heartless02egoist!"02cried02Dounia.0202
"He02is02insane,02but02not02heartless.02He02is02mad!02Don't02you02
see02it?02You're02heartless02after02that!"02Razumihin02whispered02
in02her02ear,02squeezing02her02hand02tightly.02"I02shall02be02back02
directly,"02he02shouted02to02the02horror\stricken02mother,02and02he02
ran02out02of02the02room.0202
Raskolnikov02was02waiting02for02him02at02the02end02of02the02
passage.0202
"I02knew02you02would02run02after02me,"02he02said.02"Go02back02to02
them―be02with02them...02be02with02them02to\morrow02and02
always....02I...02perhaps02I02shall02come...02if02I02can.02Good\bye."0202
And02without02holding02out02his02hand02he02walked02away.0202
"But02where02are02you02going?02What02are02you02doing?02What's02
the02matter02with02you?02How02can02you02go02on02like02this?"02
Razumihin02muttered,02at02his02wits'02end.0202
Raskolnikov02stopped02once02more.0202
"Once02for02all,02never02ask02me02about02anything.02I02have02
nothing02to02tell02you.02Don't02come02to02see02me.02Maybe02I'll02come02
here....02Leave02me,02but02don't02leave02them.02Do02you02understand02
me?"0202
It02was02dark02in02the02corridor,02they02were02standing02near02the02
lamp.02For02a02minute02they02were02looking02at02one02another02in02
silence.02Razumihin02remembered02that02minute02all02his02life.02
Raskolnikov's02 burning02 and02
intent02 eyes02 grew02 more02
penetrating02every02moment,02piercing02into02his02soul,02into02his02
consciousness.02Suddenly02Razumihin02started.02Something02
strange,02as02it02were,02passed02between02them....02Some02idea,02
some02hint,02as02it02were,02slipped,02something02awful,02hideous,02
and02suddenly02understood02on02both02sides....02Razumihin02
turned02pale.0202
"Do02you02understand02now?"02said02Raskolnikov,02his02face02
twitching02nervously.02"Go02back,02go02to02them,"02he02said02
suddenly,02and02turning02quickly,02he02went02out02of02the02house.0202
I02will02not02attempt02to02describe02how02Razumihin02went02
back02to02the02ladies,02how02he02soothed02them,02how02he02protested02
that02Rodya02needed02rest02in02his02illness,02protested02that02Rodya02
was02sure02to02come,02that02he02would02come02every02day,02that02he02
CHAPTER02IV0202
was02very,02very02much02upset,02that02he02must02not02be02irritated,02
that02he,02Razumihin,02would02watch02over02him,02would02get02him02
a02doctor,02the02best02doctor,02a02consultation....02In02fact02from02that02
evening02Razumihin02took02his02place02with02them02as02a02son02and02a02
brother.0202
02
0202
Raskolnikov02went02straight02to02the02house02on02the02canal02
bank02where02Sonia02lived.02It02was02an02old02green02house02of02three02
storeys.02He02found02the02porter02and02obtained02from02him02vague02
directions02as02to02the02whereabouts02of02Kapernaumov,02the02
tailor.02Having02found02in02the02corner02of02the02courtyard02the02
entrance02to02the02dark02and02narrow02staircase,02he02mounted02to02
the02second02floor02and02came02out02into02a02gallery02that02ran02round02
the02whole02second02storey02over02the02yard.02While02he02was02
wandering02in02the02darkness,02uncertain02where02to02turn02for02
Kapernaumov's02door,02a02door02opened02three02paces02from02
him;02he02mechanically02took02hold02of02it.0202
"Who02is02there?"02a02woman's02voice02asked02uneasily.0202
"It's02I...02come02to02see02you,"02answered02Raskolnikov02and02he02
walked02into02the02tiny02entry.0202
On02a02broken02chair02stood02a02candle02in02a02battered02copper02
candlestick.0202
"It's02you!02Good02heavens!"02cried02Sonia02weakly,02and02she02
stood02rooted02to02the02spot.0202
"Which02is02your02room?02This02way?"02and02Raskolnikov,02
trying02not02to02look02at02her,02hastened02in.0202
A02minute02later02Sonia,02too,02came02in02with02the02candle,02set02
down02the02candlestick02and,02completely02disconcerted,02stood02
before02 him02
inexpressibly02 agitated02 and02 apparently02
frightened02by02his02unexpected02visit.02The02colour02rushed02
suddenly02to02her02pale02face02and02tears02came02into02her02eyes...02
She02felt02sick02and02ashamed02and02happy,02too....02Raskolnikov02
turned02away02quickly02and02sat02on02a02chair02by02the02table.02He02
scanned02the02room02in02a02rapid02glance.0202
It02was02a02large02but02exceedingly02low\pitched02room,02the02
only02one02let02by02the02Kapernaumovs,02to02whose02rooms02a02
closed02door02led02in02the02wall02on02the02left.02In02the02opposite02side02
on02the02right02hand02wall02was02another02door,02always02kept02
locked.02That02led02to02the02next02flat,02which02formed02a02separate02
lodging.02Sonia's02room02looked02like02a02barn;02it02was02a02very02
irregular02 quadrangle02 and02 this02 gave02
it02 a02 grotesque02
appearance.02A02wall02with02three02windows02looking02out02on02to02
the02canal02ran02aslant02so02that02one02corner02formed02a02very02acute02
angle,02and02it02was02difficult02to02see02in02it02without02very02strong02
light.02The02other02corner02was02disproportionately02obtuse.02
There02was02scarcely02any02furniture02in02the02big02room:02in02the02
corner02on02the02right02was02a02bedstead,02beside02it,02nearest02the02
door,02a02chair.02A02plain,02deal02table02covered02by02a02blue02cloth02
stood02against02the02same02wall,02close02to02the02door02into02the02
other02flat.02Two02rush\bottom02chairs02stood02by02the02table.02On02
the02opposite02wall02near02the02acute02angle02stood02a02small02plain02
wooden02chest02of02drawers02looking,02as02it02were,02lost02in02a02
desert.02That02was02all02there02was02in02the02room.02The02yellow,02
scratched02and02shabby02wall\paper02was02black02in02the02corners.02
It02must02have02been02damp02and02full02of02fumes02in02the02winter.02
There02was02every02sign02of02poverty;02even02the02bedstead02had02no02
curtain.0202
Sonia02looked02in02silence02at02her02visitor,02who02was02so02
attentively02and02unceremoniously02scrutinising02her02room,02
and02even02began02at02last02to02tremble02with02terror,02as02though02
she02was02standing02before02her02judge02and02the02arbiter02of02her02
destinies.0202
"I02am02late....02It's02eleven,02isn't02it?"02he02asked,02still02not02lifting02
his02eyes.0202
"Yes,"02muttered02Sonia,02"oh02yes,02it02is,"02she02added,02hastily,02
as02though02in02that02lay02her02means02of02escape.02"My02landlady's02
clock02has02just02struck...02I02heard02it02myself...."0202
"I've02come02to02you02for02the02last02time,"02Raskolnikov02went02
on02gloomily,02although02this02was02the02first02time.02"I02may02
perhaps02not02see02you02again..."0202
"Are02you...02going02away?"0202
"I02don't02know...02to\morrow...."0202
"Then02you02are02not02coming02to02Katerina02Ivanovna02to\
morrow?"02Sonia's02voice02shook.0202
"I02don't02know.02I02shall02know02to\morrow02morning....02
Never02mind02that:02I've02come02to02say02one02word...."0202
He02raised02his02brooding02eyes02to02her02and02suddenly02
noticed02that02he02was02sitting02down02while02she02was02all02the02
while02standing02before02him.0202
"Why02are02you02standing?02Sit02down,"02he02said02in02a02changed02
voice,02gentle02and02friendly.0202
She02 sat02 down.02 He02
looked02 kindly02 and02 almost02
compassionately02at02her.0202
"How02thin02you02are!02What02a02hand!02Quite02transparent,02like02
a02dead02hand."0202
He02took02her02hand.02Sonia02smiled02faintly.0202
"I02have02always02been02like02that,"02she02said.0202
"Even02when02you02lived02at02home?"0202
"Yes."0202
"Of02course,02you02were,"02he02added02abruptly02and02the02
expression02of02his02face02and02the02sound02of02his02voice02changed02
again02suddenly.0202
He02looked02round02him02once02more.0202
"You02rent02this02room02from02the02Kapernaumovs?"0202
"Yes...."0202
"They02live02there,02through02that02door?"0202
"Yes....02They02have02another02room02like02this."0202
"All02in02one02room?"0202
"Yes."0202
"I02should02be02afraid02in02your02room02at02night,"02he02observed02
gloomily.0202
"They02are02very02good02people,02very02kind,"02answered02
Sonia,02who02still02seemed02bewildered,02"and02all02the02furniture,02
everything...02everything02is02theirs.02And02they02are02very02kind02
and02the02children,02too,02often02come02to02see02me."0202
"They02all02stammer,02don't02they?"0202
"Yes....02He02stammers02and02he's02lame.02And02his02wife,02too....02
It's02not02exactly02that02she02stammers,02but02she02can't02speak02
plainly.02She02is02a02very02kind02woman.02And02he02used02to02be02a02
house02serf.02And02there02are02seven02children...02and02it's02only02the02
eldest02one02that02stammers02and02the02others02are02simply02ill...02
but02they02don't02stammer....02But02where02did02you02hear02about02
them?"02she02added02with02some02surprise.0202
"Your02father02told02me,02then.02He02told02me02all02about02you....02
And02how02you02went02out02at02six02o'clock02and02came02back02at02nine02
and02how02Katerina02Ivanovna02knelt02down02by02your02bed."0202
Sonia02was02confused.0202
"I02
to\day,"02 she02 whispered02
fancied02
I02 saw02 him02
hesitatingly.0202
"Whom?"0202
"Father.02I02was02walking02in02the02street,02out02there02at02the02
corner,02about02ten02o'clock02and02he02seemed02to02be02walking02in02
front.02It02looked02just02like02him.02I02wanted02to02go02to02Katerina02
Ivanovna...."0202
"You02were02walking02in02the02streets?"0202
"Yes,"02Sonia02whispered02abruptly,02again02overcome02with02
confusion02and02looking02down.0202
"Katerina02Ivanovna02used02to02beat02you,02I02dare02say?"0202
"Oh02no,02what02are02you02saying?02No!"02Sonia02looked02at02him02
almost02with02dismay.0202
"You02love02her,02then?"0202
"Love02her?02Of02course!"02said02Sonia02with02plaintive02
emphasis,02and02she02clasped02her02hands02in02distress.02"Ah,02you02
don't....02If02you02only02knew!02You02see,02she02is02quite02like02a02child....02
Her02mind02is02quite02unhinged,02you02see...02from02sorrow.02And02
how02clever02she02used02to02be...02how02generous...02how02kind!02Ah,02
you02don't02understand,02you02don't02understand!"0202
Sonia02said02this02as02though02in02despair,02wringing02her02
hands02in02excitement02and02distress.02Her02pale02cheeks02flushed,02
there02was02a02look02of02anguish02in02her02eyes.02It02was02clear02that02
she02was02stirred02to02the02very02depths,02that02she02was02longing02to02
speak,02to02champion,02to02express02something.02A02sort02of02
insatiable02compassion,02if02one02may02so02express02it,02was02
reflected02in02every02feature02of02her02face.0202
"Beat02me!02how02can02you?02Good02heavens,02beat02me!02And02if02
she02did02beat02me,02what02then?02What02of02it?02You02know02nothing,02
nothing02about02it....02She02is02so02unhappy...02ah,02how02unhappy!02
And02ill....02She02is02seeking02righteousness,02she02is02pure.02She02has02
such02faith02that02there02must02be02righteousness02everywhere02
and02she02expects02it....02And02if02you02were02to02torture02her,02she02
wouldn't02do02wrong.02She02doesn't02see02that02it's02impossible02for02
people02to02be02righteous02and02she02is02angry02at02it.02Like02a02child,02
like02a02child.02She02is02good!"0202
"And02what02will02happen02to02you?"0202
Sonia02looked02at02him02inquiringly.0202
"They02are02left02on02your02hands,02you02see.02They02were02all02on02
your02hands02before,02though....02And02your02father02came02to02you02
to02beg02for02drink.02Well,02how02will02it02be02now?"0202
"I02don't02know,"02Sonia02articulated02mournfully.0202
"Will02they02stay02there?"0202
"I02don't02know....02They02are02in02debt02for02the02lodging,02but02the02
landlady,02I02hear,02said02to\day02that02she02wanted02to02get02rid02of02
them,02and02Katerina02Ivanovna02says02that02she02won't02stay02
another02minute."0202
"How02is02it02she02is02so02bold?02She02relies02upon02you?"0202
"Oh,02no,02don't02talk02like02that....02We02are02one,02we02live02like02
one."02Sonia02was02agitated02again02and02even02angry,02as02though02a02
canary02or02some02other02little02bird02were02to02be02angry.02"And02
what02could02she02do?02What,02what02could02she02do?"02she02
persisted,02getting02hot02and02excited.02"And02how02she02cried02to\
day!02Her02mind02is02unhinged,02haven't02you02noticed02it?02At02one02
minute02she02is02worrying02like02a02child02that02everything02should02

wringing02her02hands,02spitting02blood,02weeping,02and02all02at02

dragged02the02wash02tub02into02the02room02with02her02feeble02hands02
and02sank02on02the02bed,02gasping02for02breath.02We02went02this02
morning02to02the02shops02to02buy02shoes02for02Polenka02and02Lida02
for02theirs02are02quite02worn02out.02Only02the02money02we'd02
reckoned02wasn't02enough,02not02nearly02enough.02And02she02
picked02out02such02dear02little02boots,02for02she02has02taste,02you02
don't02know.02And02there02in02the02shop02she02burst02out02crying02
before02the02shopmen02because02she02hadn't02enough....02Ah,02it02
was02sad02to02see02her...."0202
"Well,02after02that02I02can02understand02your02living02like02this,"02
Raskolnikov02said02with02a02bitter02smile.0202
"And02aren't02you02sorry02for02them?02Aren't02you02sorry?"02
Sonia02flew02at02him02again.02"Why,02I02know,02you02gave02your02last02
penny02yourself,02though02you'd02seen02nothing02of02it,02and02if02
you'd02seen02everything,02oh02dear!02And02how02often,02how02often02
I've02brought02her02to02tears!02Only02last02week!02Yes,02I!02Only02a02
week02before02his02death.02I02was02cruel!02And02how02often02I've02
done02it!02Ah,02I've02been02wretched02at02the02thought02of02it02all02day!"0202
Sonia02wrung02her02hands02as02she02spoke02at02the02pain02of02
remembering02it.0202
"You02were02cruel?"0202
"Yes,02I―I.02I02went02to02see02them,"02she02went02on,02weeping,02
"and02father02said,02'read02me02something,02Sonia,02my02head02

They02just02reminded02her02of02her02old02happy02days.02She02looked02

asked02for,02she02liked02them02so02much.02And02I02was02sorry02to02give02

said.02I02spoke02like02that02to02her,02I02ought02not02to02have02said02that!02
She02gave02me02such02a02look.02And02she02was02so02grieved,02so02
grieved02at02my02refusing02her.02And02it02was02so02sad02to02see....02And02
she02was02not02grieved02for02the02collars,02but02for02my02refusing,02I02
saw02that.02Ah,02if02only02I02could02bring02it02all02back,02change02it,02take02
back02those02words!02Ah,02if02I...02but02it's02nothing02to02you!"0202
"Did02you02know02Lizaveta,02the02pedlar?"0202
"Yes....02Did02you02know02her?"02Sonia02asked02with02some02
surprise.0202
consumption,02
"Katerina02
rapid02
in02
Ivanovna02
consumption;02she02will02soon02die,"02said02Raskolnikov02after02a02
pause,02without02answering02her02question.0202
"Oh,02no,02no,02no!"0202
And02Sonia02unconsciously02clutched02both02his02hands,02as02
though02imploring02that02she02should02not.0202
"But02it02will02be02better02if02she02does02die."0202
"No,02not02better,02not02at02all02better!"02Sonia02unconsciously02
repeated02in02dismay.0202
"And02the02children?02What02can02you02do02except02take02them02
to02live02with02you?"0202
"Oh,02I02don't02know,"02cried02Sonia,02almost02in02despair,02and02
she02put02her02hands02to02her02head.0202
It02was02evident02that02that02idea02had02very02often02occurred02to02
her02before02and02he02had02only02roused02it02again.0202
"And,02what,02if02even02now,02while02Katerina02Ivanovna02is02
alive,02you02get02ill02and02are02taken02to02the02hospital,02what02will02
happen02then?"02he02persisted02pitilessly.0202
"How02can02you?02That02cannot02be!"0202
And02Sonia's02face02worked02with02awful02terror.0202
"Cannot02be?"02Raskolnikov02went02on02with02a02harsh02smile.02
"You02are02not02insured02against02it,02are02you?02What02will02happen02
to02them02then?02They02will02be02in02the02street,02all02of02them,02she02
will02cough02and02beg02and02knock02her02head02against02some02wall,02
as02she02did02to\day,02and02the02children02will02cry....02Then02she02will02
fall02down,02be02taken02to02the02police02station02and02to02the02
hospital,02she02will02die,02and02the02children..."0202
"Oh,02no....02God02will02not02let02it02be!"02broke02at02last02from02
Sonia's02overburdened02bosom.0202
She02listened,02looking02imploringly02at02him,02clasping02her02
hands02in02dumb02entreaty,02as02though02it02all02depended02upon02
him.0202Raskolnikov02got02up02and02began02to02walk02about02the02room.02
A02minute02passed.02Sonia02was02standing02with02her02hands02and02
her02head02hanging02in02terrible02dejection.0202
"And02can't02you02save?02Put02by02for02a02rainy02day?"02he02asked,02
stopping02suddenly02before02her.0202
"No,"02whispered02Sonia.0202
"Of02course02not.02Have02you02tried?"02he02added02almost02
ironically.0202
"Yes."0202
"And02it02didn't02come02off!02Of02course02not!02No02need02to02ask."0202
And02again02he02paced02the02room.02Another02minute02passed.0202
"You02don't02get02money02every02day?"0202
Sonia02was02more02confused02than02ever02and02colour02rushed02
into02her02face02again.0202
"No,"02she02whispered02with02a02painful02effort.0202
"It02will02be02the02same02with02Polenka,02no02doubt,"02he02said02
suddenly.0202
"No,02 no!02 It02 can't02 be,02 no!"02 Sonia02 cried02 aloud02
in02
desperation,02as02though02she02had02been02stabbed.02"God02would02
not02allow02anything02so02awful!"0202
"He02lets02others02come02to02it."0202
"No,02no!02God02will02protect02her,02God!"02she02repeated02beside02
herself.0202
"But,02perhaps,02there02is02no02God02at02all,"02Raskolnikov02
answered02with02a02sort02of02malignance,02laughed02and02looked02at02
her.0202Sonia's02face02suddenly02changed;02a02tremor02passed02over02it.02
She02looked02at02him02with02unutterable02reproach,02tried02to02say02
something,02but02could02not02speak02and02broke02into02bitter,02
bitter02sobs,02hiding02her02face02in02her02hands.0202
"You02say02Katerina02Ivanovna's02mind02is02unhinged;02your02
own02mind02is02unhinged,"02he02said02after02a02brief02silence.0202
Five02minutes02passed.02He02still02paced02up02and02down02the02
room02in02silence,02not02looking02at02her.02At02last02he02went02up02to02
her;02his02eyes02glittered.02He02put02his02two02hands02on02her02
shoulders02and02looked02straight02into02her02tearful02face.02His02
eyes02were02hard,02feverish02and02piercing,02his02lips02were02
twitching.02All02at02once02he02bent02down02quickly02and02dropping02
to02the02ground,02kissed02her02foot.02Sonia02drew02back02from02him02
as02from02a02madman.02And02certainly02he02looked02like02a02
madman.0202
"What02are02you02doing02to02me?"02she02muttered,02turning02
pale,02and02a02sudden02anguish02clutched02at02her02heart.0202
He02stood02up02at02once.0202
"I02did02not02bow02down02to02you,02I02bowed02down02to02all02the02
suffering02of02humanity,"02he02said02wildly02and02walked02away02to02
the02window.02"Listen,"02he02added,02turning02to02her02a02minute02
later.02"I02said02just02now02to02an02insolent02man02that02he02was02not02
worth02your02little02finger...02and02that02I02did02my02sister02honour02
making02her02sit02beside02you."0202
"Ach,02you02said02that02to02them!02And02in02her02presence?"02cried02
Sonia,02frightened.02"Sit02down02with02me!02An02honour!02Why,02
I'm...02dishonourable....02Ah,02why02did02you02say02that?"0202
"It02was02not02because02of02your02dishonour02and02your02sin02I02
said02that02of02you,02but02because02of02your02great02suffering.02But02
you02are02a02great02sinner,02that's02true,"02he02added02almost02
solemnly,02"and02your02worst02sin02is02that02you02have02destroyed02
and02betrayed02yourself02for02nothing.02Isn't02that02fearful?02Isn't02it02
fearful02that02you02are02living02in02this02filth02which02you02loathe02so,02
and02at02the02same02time02you02know02yourself02(you've02only02to02
open02your02eyes)02that02you02are02not02helping02anyone02by02it,02not02
saving02anyone02from02anything?02Tell02me,"02he02went02on02almost02
in02a02frenzy,02"how02this02shame02and02degradation02can02exist02in02
you02side02by02side02with02other,02opposite,02holy02feelings?02It02
would02be02better,02a02thousand02times02better02and02wiser02to02leap02
into02the02water02and02end02it02all!"0202
"But02what02would02become02of02them?"02Sonia02asked02faintly,02
gazing02at02him02with02eyes02of02anguish,02but02not02seeming02
surprised02at02his02suggestion.0202
Raskolnikov02looked02strangely02at02her.02He02read02it02all02in02
her02face;02so02she02must02have02had02that02thought02already,02
perhaps02many02times,02and02earnestly02she02had02thought02out02in02
her02despair02how02to02end02it02and02so02earnestly,02that02now02she02
scarcely02wondered02at02his02suggestion.02She02had02not02even02
noticed02the02cruelty02of02his02words.02(The02significance02of02his02
reproaches02and02his02peculiar02attitude02to02her02shame02she02had,02
of02course,02not02noticed02either,02and02that,02too,02was02clear02to02
him.)02But02he02saw02how02monstrously02the02thought02of02her02
disgraceful,02shameful02position02was02torturing02her02and02had02
long02tortured02her.02"What,02what,"02he02thought,02"could02
hitherto02have02hindered02her02from02putting02an02end02to02it?"02
Only02then02he02realised02what02those02poor02little02orphan02
children02and02that02pitiful02half\crazy02Katerina02Ivanovna,02
knocking02her02head02against02the02wall02in02her02consumption,02
meant02for02Sonia.0202
But,02nevertheless,02it02was02clear02to02him02again02that02with02
her02character02and02the02amount02of02education02she02had02after02
all02received,02she02could02not02in02any02case02remain02so.02He02was02
still02confronted02by02the02question,02how02could02she02have02
remained02so02long02in02that02position02without02going02out02of02her02
mind,02since02she02could02not02bring02herself02to02jump02into02the02
water?02Of02course02he02knew02that02Sonia's02position02was02an02
exceptional02case,02though02unhappily02not02unique02and02not02
infrequent,02indeed;02but02that02very02exceptionalness,02her02
tinge02of02education,02her02previous02life02might,02one02would02have02
thought,02have02killed02her02at02the02first02step02on02that02revolting02
path.02What02held02her02up―surely02not02depravity?02All02that02
infamy02had02obviously02only02touched02her02mechanically,02not02
one02drop02of02real02depravity02had02penetrated02to02her02heart;02he02
saw02that.02He02saw02through02her02as02she02stood02before02him....0202
"There02are02three02ways02before02her,"02he02thought,02"the02
canal,02the02madhouse,02or...02at02last02to02sink02into02depravity02
which02obscures02the02mind02and02turns02the02heart02to02stone."0202
The02last02idea02was02the02most02revolting,02but02he02was02a02
sceptic,02he02was02young,02abstract,02and02therefore02cruel,02and02so02
he02could02not02help02believing02that02the02last02end02was02the02most02
likely.0202
"But02can02that02be02true?"02he02cried02to02himself.02"Can02that02
creature02who02has02still02preserved02the02purity02of02her02spirit02be02
consciously02drawn02at02last02into02that02sink02of02filth02and02
iniquity?02Can02the02process02already02have02begun?02Can02it02be02
that02she02has02only02been02able02to02bear02it02till02now,02because02vice02
has02begun02to02be02less02loathsome02to02her?02No,02no,02that02cannot02
be!"02he02cried,02as02Sonia02had02just02before.02"No,02what02has02kept02
her02from02the02canal02till02now02is02the02idea02of02sin02and02they,02the02
children....02And02if02she02has02not02gone02out02of02her02mind...02but02
who02says02she02has02not02gone02out02of02her02mind?02Is02she02in02her02
senses?02Can02one02talk,02can02one02reason02as02she02does?02How02can02
she02sit02on02the02edge02of02the02abyss02of02loathsomeness02into02
which02she02is02slipping02and02refuse02to02listen02when02she02is02told02
of02danger?02Does02she02expect02a02miracle?02No02doubt02she02does.02
Doesn't02that02all02mean02madness?"0202
He02stayed02obstinately02at02that02thought.02He02liked02that02
explanation02indeed02better02than02any02other.02He02began02
looking02more02intently02at02her.0202
"So02you02pray02to02God02a02great02deal,02Sonia?"02he02asked02her.0202
Sonia02did02not02speak;02he02stood02beside02her02waiting02for02an02
answer.0202
"What02should02I02be02without02God?"02she02whispered02
rapidly,02forcibly,02glancing02at02him02with02suddenly02flashing02
eyes,02and02squeezing02his02hand.0202
"Ah,02so02that02is02it!"02he02thought.0202
"And02what02does02God02do02for02you?"02he02asked,02probing02her02
further.0202
Sonia02was02silent02a02long02while,02as02though02she02could02not02
answer.02Her02weak02chest02kept02heaving02with02emotion.0202
"Be02silent!02Don't02ask!02You02don't02deserve!"02she02cried02
suddenly,02looking02sternly02and02wrathfully02at02him.0202
"That's02it,02that's02it,"02he02repeated02to02himself.0202
"He02does02everything,"02she02whispered02quickly,02looking02
down02again.0202
"That's02the02way02out!02That's02the02explanation,"02he02
decided,02scrutinising02her02with02eager02curiosity,02with02a02new,02
strange,02almost02morbid02feeling.02He02gazed02at02that02pale,02thin,02
irregular,02angular02little02face,02those02soft02blue02eyes,02which02
could02flash02with02such02fire,02such02stern02energy,02that02little02
body02still02shaking02with02indignation02and02anger―and02it02all02
seemed02to02him02more02and02more02strange,02almost02impossible.02
"She02is02a02religious02maniac!"02he02repeated02to02himself.0202
There02was02a02book02lying02on02the02chest02of02drawers.02He02had02
noticed02it02every02time02he02paced02up02and02down02the02room.02
Now02he02took02it02up02and02looked02at02it.02It02was02the02New02
Testament02in02the02Russian02translation.02It02was02bound02in02
leather,02old02and02worn.0202
"Where02did02you02get02that?"02he02called02to02her02across02the02
room.0202She02was02still02standing02in02the02same02place,02three02steps02
from02the02table.0202
"It02was02brought02me,"02she02answered,02as02it02were02
unwillingly,02not02looking02at02him.0202
"Who02brought02it?"0202
"Lizaveta,02I02asked02her02for02it."0202
"Lizaveta!02strange!"02he02thought.0202
Everything02about02Sonia02seemed02to02him02stranger02and02
more02wonderful02every02moment.02He02carried02the02book02to02the02
candle02and02began02to02turn02over02the02pages.0202
"Where02is02the02story02of02Lazarus?"02he02asked02suddenly.0202
Sonia02looked02obstinately02at02the02ground02and02would02not02
answer.02She02was02standing02sideways02to02the02table.0202
"Where02is02the02raising02of02Lazarus?02Find02it02for02me,02Sonia."0202
She02stole02a02glance02at02him.0202
"You02are02not02looking02in02the02right02place....02It's02in02the02
fourth02gospel,"02she02whispered02sternly,02without02looking02at02
him.0202"Find02it02and02read02it02to02me,"02he02said.02He02sat02down02with02
his02elbow02on02the02table,02leaned02his02head02on02his02hand02and02
looked02away02sullenly,02prepared02to02listen.0202
"In02three02weeks'02time02they'll02welcome02me02in02the02
madhouse!02I02shall02be02there02if02I02am02not02in02a02worse02place,"02he02
muttered02to02himself.0202
Sonia02heard02Raskolnikov's02request02distrustfully02and02
moved02hesitatingly02to02the02table.02She02took02the02book02
however.0202
"Haven't02you02read02it?"02she02asked,02looking02up02at02him02
across02the02table.0202
Her02voice02became02sterner02and02sterner.0202
"Long02ago....02When02I02was02at02school.02Read!"0202
"And02haven't02you02heard02it02in02church?"0202
"I...02haven't02been.02Do02you02often02go?"0202
"N\no,"02whispered02Sonia.0202
Raskolnikov02smiled.0202
"I02understand....02And02you02won't02go02to02your02father's02
funeral02to\morrow?"0202
"Yes,02I02shall.02I02was02at02church02last02week,02too...02I02had02a02
requiem02service."0202
"For02whom?"0202
"For02Lizaveta.02She02was02killed02with02an02axe."0202
His02nerves02were02more02and02more02strained.02His02head02
began02to02go02round.0202
"Were02you02friends02with02Lizaveta?"0202
"Yes....02She02was02good...02she02used02to02come...02not02often...02
she02couldn't....02We02used02to02read02together02and...02talk.02She02will02
see02God."0202
The02last02phrase02sounded02strange02in02his02ears.02And02here02
was02something02new02again:02the02mysterious02meetings02with02
Lizaveta02and02both02of02them―religious02maniacs.0202
"I02shall02be02a02religious02maniac02myself02soon!02It's02
infectious!"0202
"Read!"02he02cried02irritably02and02insistently.0202
Sonia02still02hesitated.02Her02heart02was02throbbing.02She02
hardly02dared02to02read02to02him.02He02looked02almost02with02
exasperation02at02the02"unhappy02lunatic."0202
"What02for?02You02don't02believe?..."02she02whispered02softly02
and02as02it02were02breathlessly.0202
"Read!02I02want02you02to,"02he02persisted.02"You02used02to02read02
to02Lizaveta."0202
Sonia02opened02the02book02and02found02the02place.02Her02hands02
were02shaking,02her02voice02failed02her.02Twice02she02tried02to02begin02
and02could02not02bring02out02the02first02syllable.0202
"Now02a02certain02man02was02sick02named02Lazarus02of02
Bethany..."02she02forced02herself02at02last02to02read,02but02at02the02
third02word02her02voice02broke02like02an02overstrained02string.02
There02was02a02catch02in02her02breath.0202
Raskolnikov02saw02in02part02why02Sonia02could02not02bring02
herself02to02read02to02him02and02the02more02he02saw02this,02the02more02
roughly02and02irritably02he02insisted02on02her02doing02so.02He02
understood02only02too02well02how02painful02it02was02for02her02to02
betray02and02unveil02all02that02was02her02own.02He02understood02that02
these02feelings02really02were02her02 secret02treasure,02which02she02
had02kept02perhaps02for02years,02perhaps02from02childhood,02while02
she02lived02with02an02unhappy02father02and02a02distracted02
stepmother02crazed02by02grief,02in02the02midst02of02starving02
children02and02unseemly02abuse02and02reproaches.02But02at02the02
same02time02he02knew02now02and02knew02for02certain02that,02
although02it02filled02her02with02dread02and02suffering,02yet02she02had02
a02tormenting02desire02to02read02and02to02read02to02 him02that02he02
might02hear02it,02and02to02read02now02whatever02might02come02of02it!...02
He02read02this02in02her02eyes,02he02could02see02it02in02her02intense02
emotion.02She02mastered02herself,02controlled02the02spasm02in02her02
throat02and02went02on02reading02the02eleventh02chapter02of02St.02
John.02She02went02on02to02the02nineteenth02verse:0202
"And02many02of02the02Jews02came02to02Martha02and02Mary02to02
comfort02them02concerning02their02brother.0202
"Then02Martha02as02soon02as02she02heard02that02Jesus02was02
coming02went02and02met02Him:02but02Mary02sat02still02in02the02house.0202
"Then02said02Martha02unto02Jesus,02Lord,02if02Thou02hadst02been02

"But02I02know02that02even02now02whatsoever02Thou02wilt02ask02of02
God,02God02will02give02it02Thee...."0202
Then02she02stopped02again02with02a02shamefaced02feeling02that02
her02voice02would02quiver02and02break02again.0202
"Jesus02said02unto02her,02thy02brother02shall02rise02again.0202
"Martha02saith02unto02Him,02I02know02that02he02shall02rise02again02
in02the02resurrection,02at02the02last02day.0202

die.02Believest02thou02this?0202
"She02saith02unto02Him,"0202
(And02drawing02a02painful02breath,02Sonia02read02distinctly02
and02 forcibly02 as02 though02 she02 were02 making02 a02 public02
confession02of02faith.)0202
"Yea,02Lord:02I02believe02that02Thou02art02the02Christ,02the02Son02of02
God02Which02should02come02into02the02world."0202
She02stopped02and02looked02up02quickly02at02him,02but02
controlling02herself02went02on02reading.02Raskolnikov02sat02
without02moving,02his02elbows02on02the02table02and02his02eyes02
turned02away.02She02read02to02the02thirty\second02verse.0202
"Then02when02Mary02was02come02where02Jesus02was02and02saw02
Him,02she02fell02down02at02His02feet,02saying02unto02Him,02Lord02if02

"When02Jesus02therefore02saw02her02weeping,02and02the02Jews02
also02weeping02which02came02with02her,02He02groaned02in02the02
spirit02and02was02troubled,0202
"And02said,02Where02have02ye02laid02him?02They02said02unto02Him,02

"Jesus02wept.0202
"Then02said02the02Jews,02behold02how02He02loved02him!0202
"And02some02of02them02said,02could02not02this02Man02which02

Raskolnikov02turned02and02looked02at02her02with02emotion.02
Yes,02he02had02known02it!02She02was02trembling02in02a02real02physical02
fever.02He02had02expected02it.02She02was02getting02near02the02story02of02
the02greatest02miracle02and02a02feeling02of02immense02triumph02
came02over02her.02Her02voice02rang02out02like02a02bell;02triumph02and02
joy02gave02it02power.02The02lines02danced02before02her02eyes,02but02
she02knew02what02she02was02reading02by02heart.02At02the02last02verse02
"Could02not02this02Man02which02opened02the02eyes02of02the02blind..."02
dropping02her02voice02she02passionately02reproduced02the02
doubt,02the02reproach02and02censure02of02the02blind02disbelieving02
Jews,02who02in02another02moment02would02fall02at02His02feet02as02

he,02too,02will02believe,02yes,02yes!02At02once,02now,"02was02what02she02
was02 dreaming,02 and02 she02 was02 quivering02 with02 happy02
anticipation.0202
"Jesus02therefore02again02groaning02in02Himself02cometh02to02
the02grave.02It02was02a02cave,02and02a02stone02lay02upon02it.0202
"Jesus02said,02Take02ye02away02the02stone.02Martha,02the02sister02

She02laid02emphasis02on02the02word02four.0202
"Jesus02saith02unto02her,02Said02I02not02unto02thee02that02if02thou02

"Then02they02took02away02the02stone02from02the02place02where02
the02dead02was02laid.02And02Jesus02lifted02up02His02eyes02and02said,02
Father,02I02thank02Thee02that02Thou02hast02heard02Me.0202
"And02I02knew02that02Thou02hearest02Me02always;02but02because02

"And02when02He02thus02had02spoken,02He02cried02with02a02loud02
voice,02Lazarus,02come02forth.0202
"And02he02that02was02dead02came02forth."0202
(She02read02loudly,02cold02and02trembling02with02ecstasy,02as02
though02she02were02seeing02it02before02her02eyes.)0202
"Bound02hand02and02foot02with02graveclothes;02and02his02face02

She02could02read02no02more,02closed02the02book02and02got02up02
from02her02chair02quickly.0202
"That02is02all02about02the02raising02of02Lazarus,"02she02whispered02
severely02and02abruptly,02and02turning02away02she02stood02
motionless,02not02daring02to02raise02her02eyes02to02him.02She02still02
trembled02feverishly.02The02candle\end02was02flickering02out02in02
the02battered02candlestick,02dimly02lighting02up02in02the02poverty\
stricken02room02the02murderer02and02the02harlot02who02had02so02
strangely02been02reading02together02the02eternal02book.02Five02
minutes02or02more02passed.0202
"I02came02to02speak02of02something,"02Raskolnikov02said02aloud,02
frowning.02He02got02up02and02went02to02Sonia.02She02lifted02her02eyes02
to02him02in02silence.02His02face02was02particularly02stern02and02there02
was02a02sort02of02savage02determination02in02it.0202
"I02have02abandoned02my02family02to\day,"02he02said,02"my02
mother02and02sister.02I02am02not02going02to02see02them.02I've02broken02
with02them02completely."0202
"What02for?"02asked02Sonia02amazed.02Her02recent02meeting02
with02his02mother02and02sister02had02left02a02great02impression02
which02she02could02not02analyse.02She02heard02his02news02almost02
with02horror.0202
"I02have02only02you02now,"02he02added.02"Let02us02go02together....02
I've02come02to02you,02we02are02both02accursed,02let02us02go02our02way02
together!"0202
His02eyes02glittered02"as02though02he02were02mad,"02Sonia02
thought,02in02her02turn.0202
"Go02where?"02she02asked02in02alarm02and02she02involuntarily02
stepped02back.0202
"How02do02I02know?02I02only02know02it's02the02same02road,02I02know02
that02and02nothing02more.02It's02the02same02goal!"0202
She02looked02at02him02and02understood02nothing.02She02knew02
only02that02he02was02terribly,02infinitely02unhappy.0202
"No02one02of02them02will02understand,02if02you02tell02them,02but02I02
have02understood.02I02need02you,02that02is02why02I02have02come02to02
you."0202"I02don't02understand,"02whispered02Sonia.0202
"You'll02understand02later.02Haven't02you02done02the02same?02
You,02too,02have02transgressed...02have02had02the02strength02to02
transgress.02You02have02laid02hands02on02yourself,02you02have02
destroyed02a02life...02 your02own02(it's02all02the02same!).02You02might02

the02Hay02Market....02But02you02won't02be02able02to02stand02it,02and02if02
you02remain02alone02you'll02go02out02of02your02mind02like02me.02You02
are02like02a02mad02creature02already.02So02we02must02go02together02on02
the02same02road!02Let02us02go!"0202
"What02for?02What's02all02this02for?"02said02Sonia,02strangely02
and02violently02agitated02by02his02words.0202
"What02for?02Because02you02can't02remain02like02this,02that's02
why!02You02must02look02things02straight02in02the02face02at02last,02and02
not02weep02like02a02child02and02cry02that02God02won't02allow02it.02What02
will02happen,02if02you02should02really02be02taken02to02the02hospital02
to\morrow?02She02is02mad02and02in02consumption,02she'll02soon02
die02and02the02children?02Do02you02mean02to02tell02me02Polenka02
won't02come02to02grief?02Haven't02you02seen02children02here02at02the02

out02where02those02mothers02live02and02in02what02surroundings.02
Children02can't02remain02children02there!02At02seven02the02child02is02
vicious02and02a02thief.02Yet02children,02you02know,02are02the02image02
of02Christ:02'theirs02is02the02kingdom02of02Heaven.'02He02bade02us02
honour02and02love02them,02they02are02the02humanity02of02the02
future...."0202
"What's02to02be02done,02what's02to02be02done?"02repeated02Sonia,02
weeping02hysterically02and02wringing02her02hands.0202
"What's02to02be02done?02Break02what02must02be02broken,02once02
for02all,02that's02all,02and02take02the02suffering02on02oneself.02What,02

they02meant.02If02I02come02to\morrow,02I'll02tell02you02who02killed02
Lizaveta....02Good\bye."0202
Sonia02started02with02terror.0202
"Why,02do02you02know02who02killed02her?"02she02asked,02chilled02
with02horror,02looking02wildly02at02him.0202
"I02know02and02will02tell...02you,02only02you.02I02have02chosen02you02
out.02I'm02not02coming02to02you02to02ask02forgiveness,02but02simply02

He02went02out.02Sonia02gazed02at02him02as02at02a02madman.02But02
she02herself02was02like02one02insane02and02felt02it.02Her02head02was02

What02did02those02words02mean?02It's02awful!"02But02at02the02same02
time02 the02idea02did02not02enter02her02head,02not02for02a02moment!02
"Oh,02he02must02be02terribly02unhappy!...02He02has02abandoned02his02

what02had02he02in02his02mind?02What02did02he02say02to02her?02He02had02
kissed02her02foot02and02said...02said02(yes,02he02had02said02it02clearly)02
that02he02could02not02live02without02her....02Oh,02merciful02heavens!"0202
Sonia02spent02the02whole02night02feverish02and02delirious.02She02
jumped02up02from02time02to02time,02wept02and02wrung02her02hands,02
then02sank02again02into02feverish02sleep02and02dreamt02of02Polenka,02

him...02him02with02pale02face,02with02burning02eyes...02kissing02her02
feet,02weeping.0202
On02the02other02side02of02the02door02on02the02right,02which02
divided02Sonia's02room02from02Madame02Resslich's02flat,02was02a02

gate02and02a02notice02stuck02in02the02windows02over02the02canal02
advertising02it02to02let.02Sonia02had02long02been02accustomed02to02the02

time02 Mr.02
that02
Svidriga07lov02had02been02standing,02listening02at02the02door02of02the02
empty02room.02When02Raskolnikov02went02out02he02stood02still,02
thought02a02moment,02went02on02tiptoe02to02his02own02room02which02
adjoined02the02empty02one,02brought02a02chair02and02noiselessly02
carried02it02to02the02door02that02led02to02Sonia's02room.02The02
conversation02 had02 struck02 him02 as02
interesting02 and02
remarkable,02and02he02had02greatly02enjoyed02it―so02much02so02
that02he02brought02a02chair02that02he02might02not02in02the02future,02to\
morrow,02for02instance,02have02to02endure02the02inconvenience02of02
standing02a02whole02hour,02but02might02listen02in02comfort.0202
02
0202
When02next02morning02at02eleven02o'clock02punctually02
Raskolnikov02went02into02the02department02of02the02investigation02
of02criminal02causes02and02sent02his02name02in02to02Porfiry02
CHAPTER02V0202
Petrovitch,02he02was02surprised02at02being02kept02waiting02so02long:02
it02was02at02least02ten02minutes02before02he02was02summoned.02He02
had02expected02that02they02would02pounce02upon02him.02But02he02
stood02in02the02waiting\room,02and02people,02who02apparently02
had02nothing02to02do02with02him,02were02continually02passing02to02
and02fro02before02him.02In02the02next02room02which02looked02like02an02
office,02several02clerks02were02sitting02writing02and02obviously02
they02had02no02notion02who02or02what02Raskolnikov02might02be.02He02
looked02uneasily02and02suspiciously02about02him02to02see02
whether02there02was02not02some02guard,02some02mysterious02
watch02being02kept02on02him02to02prevent02his02escape.02But02there02
was02nothing02of02the02sort:02he02saw02only02the02faces02of02clerks02
absorbed02in02petty02details,02then02other02people,02no02one02
seemed02to02have02any02concern02with02him.02He02might02go02where02
he02liked02for02them.02The02conviction02grew02stronger02in02him02
that02if02that02enigmatic02man02of02yesterday,02that02phantom02
sprung02out02of02the02earth,02had02seen02everything,02they02would02
not02have02let02him02stand02and02wait02like02that.02And02would02they02
have02waited02till02he02elected02to02appear02at02eleven?02Either02the02
man02had02not02yet02given02information,02or...02or02simply02he02knew02
nothing,02had02seen02nothing02(and02how02could02he02have02seen02
anything?)02and02so02all02that02had02happened02to02him02the02day02
before02was02again02a02phantom02exaggerated02by02his02sick02and02
overstrained02imagination.02This02conjecture02had02begun02to02
grow02strong02the02day02before,02in02the02midst02of02all02his02alarm02
and02despair.02Thinking02it02all02over02now02and02preparing02for02a02
fresh02conflict,02he02was02suddenly02aware02that02he02was02
trembling―and02he02felt02a02rush02of02indignation02at02the02thought02
that02he02was02trembling02with02fear02at02facing02that02hateful02
Porfiry02Petrovitch.02What02he02dreaded02above02all02was02
meeting02that02man02again;02he02hated02him02with02an02intense,02
unmitigated02hatred02and02was02afraid02his02hatred02might02betray02
him.02His02indignation02was02such02that02he02ceased02trembling02at02
once;02he02made02ready02to02go02in02with02a02cold02and02arrogant02
bearing02and02vowed02to02himself02to02keep02as02silent02as02possible,02
to02watch02and02listen02and02for02once02at02least02to02control02his02
overstrained02nerves.02At02that02moment02he02was02summoned02to02
Porfiry02Petrovitch.0202
He02found02Porfiry02Petrovitch02alone02in02his02study.02His02
study02was02a02room02neither02large02nor02small,02furnished02with02a02
large02writing\table,02that02stood02before02a02sofa,02upholstered02in02
checked02material,02a02bureau,02a02bookcase02in02the02corner02and02
several02chairs―all02government02furniture,02of02polished02
yellow02wood.02In02the02further02wall02there02was02a02closed02door,02
beyond02
it02 there02 were02 no02 doubt02 other02 rooms.02 On02
Raskolnikov's02entrance02Porfiry02Petrovitch02had02at02once02
closed02the02door02by02which02he02had02come02in02and02they02
remained02alone.02He02met02his02visitor02with02an02apparently02
genial02and02good\tempered02air,02and02it02was02only02after02a02few02
that02 Raskolnikov02 saw02 signs02 of02 a02 certain02
minutes02
awkwardness02in02him,02as02though02he02had02been02thrown02out02of02
his02reckoning02or02caught02in02something02very02secret.0202
"Ah,02my02dear02fellow!02Here02you02are...02in02our02domain"...02
began02Porfiry,02holding02out02both02hands02to02him.02"Come,02sit02
down,02old02man...02or02perhaps02you02don't02like02to02be02called02'my02
dear02fellow'02and02'old02man!'―tout02court?02Please02don't02think02
it02too02familiar....02Here,02on02the02sofa."0202
Raskolnikov02sat02down,02keeping02his02eyes02fixed02on02him.02
"In02our02domain,"02the02apologies02for02familiarity,02the02French02
phrase02tout02court,02were02all02characteristic02signs.0202
"He02held02out02both02hands02to02me,02but02he02did02not02give02me02
one―he02drew02it02back02in02time,"02struck02him02suspiciously.02
Both02were02watching02each02other,02but02when02their02eyes02met,02
quick02as02lightning02they02looked02away.0202
"I02brought02you02this02paper...02about02the02watch.02Here02it02is.02
Is02it02all02right02or02shall02I02copy02it02again?"0202
"What?02A02paper?02Yes,02yes,02don't02be02uneasy,02it's02all02right,"02
Porfiry02Petrovitch02said02as02though02in02haste,02and02after02he02had02
said02it02he02took02the02paper02and02looked02at02it.02"Yes,02it's02all02right.02
Nothing02more02is02needed,"02he02declared02with02the02same02
rapidity02and02he02laid02the02paper02on02the02table.0202
A02minute02later02when02he02was02talking02of02something02else02
he02took02it02from02the02table02and02put02it02on02his02bureau.0202
"I02believe02you02said02yesterday02you02would02like02to02question02
me...02formally...02about02my02acquaintance02with02the02murdered02
woman?"02Raskolnikov02was02beginning02again.02"Why02did02I02put02
in02'I02believe'"02passed02through02his02mind02in02a02flash.02"Why02am02
I02so02uneasy02at02having02put02in02that02'I02believe'?"02came02in02a02
second02flash.02And02he02suddenly02felt02that02his02uneasiness02at02
the02mere02contact02with02Porfiry,02at02the02first02words,02at02the02
first02looks,02had02grown02in02an02instant02to02monstrous02
proportions,02and02that02this02was02fearfully02dangerous.02His02
nerves02were02quivering,02his02emotion02was02increasing.02"It's02
bad,02it's02bad!02I02shall02say02too02much02again."0202
"Yes,02yes,02yes!02There's02no02hurry,02there's02no02hurry,"02
muttered02Porfiry02Petrovitch,02moving02to02and02fro02about02the02
table02without02any02apparent02aim,02as02it02were02making02dashes02
towards02the02window,02the02bureau02and02the02table,02at02one02
moment02avoiding02Raskolnikov's02suspicious02glance,02then02
again02standing02still02and02looking02him02straight02in02the02face.0202
His02fat02round02little02figure02looked02very02strange,02like02a02ball02
rolling02from02one02side02to02the02other02and02rebounding02back.0202
"We've02plenty02of02time.02Do02you02smoke?02have02you02your02
own?02Here,02a02cigarette!"02he02went02on,02offering02his02visitor02a02
cigarette.02"You02know02I02am02receiving02you02here,02but02my02own02
quarters02are02through02there,02you02know,02my02government02
quarters.02But02I02am02living02outside02for02the02time,02I02had02to02have02
some02repairs02done02here.02It's02almost02finished02now....02
Government02quarters,02you02know,02are02a02capital02thing.02Eh,02
what02do02you02think?"0202
"Yes,02a02capital02thing,"02answered02Raskolnikov,02looking02at02
him02almost02ironically.0202
"A02capital02thing,02a02capital02thing,"02repeated02Porfiry02
Petrovitch,02as02though02he02had02just02thought02of02something02
quite02different.02"Yes,02a02capital02thing,"02he02almost02shouted02at02
last,02suddenly02staring02at02Raskolnikov02and02stopping02short02
two02steps02from02him.0202
This02stupid02repetition02was02too02incongruous02in02its02
ineptitude02with02the02serious,02brooding02and02enigmatic02
glance02he02turned02upon02his02visitor.0202
But02this02stirred02Raskolnikov's02spleen02more02than02ever02
and02he02could02not02resist02an02ironical02and02rather02incautious02
challenge.0202
"Tell02me,02please,"02he02asked02suddenly,02looking02almost02
insolently02at02him02and02taking02a02kind02of02pleasure02in02his02own02
insolence.02"I02believe02it's02a02sort02of02legal02rule,02a02sort02of02legal02
tradition―for02all02investigating02lawyers―to02begin02their02
attack02from02afar,02with02a02trivial,02or02at02least02an02irrelevant02
subject,02so02as02to02encourage,02or02rather,02to02divert02the02man02
they02are02cross\examining,02to02disarm02his02caution02and02then02
all02at02once02to02give02him02an02unexpected02knock\down02blow02
with02some02fatal02question.02Isn't02that02so?02It's02a02sacred02
tradition,02mentioned,02I02fancy,02in02all02the02manuals02of02the02art?"0202
"Yes,02yes....02Why,02do02you02imagine02that02was02why02I02spoke02
about02government02quarters...02eh?"0202
And02as02he02said02this02Porfiry02Petrovitch02screwed02up02his02
eyes02and02winked;02a02good\humoured,02crafty02look02passed02
over02his02 face.02The02wrinkles02on02 his02forehead02were02
smoothed02out,02his02eyes02contracted,02his02features02broadened02
and02he02suddenly02went02off02into02a02nervous02prolonged02laugh,02
shaking02all02over02and02looking02Raskolnikov02straight02in02the02
face.02The02latter02forced02himself02to02laugh,02too,02but02when02
Porfiry,02seeing02that02he02was02laughing,02broke02into02such02a02
guffaw02that02he02turned02almost02crimson,02Raskolnikov's02
repulsion02overcame02all02precaution;02he02left02off02laughing,02
scowled02and02stared02with02hatred02at02Porfiry,02keeping02his02
eyes02fixed02on02him02while02his02intentionally02prolonged02
laughter02lasted.02There02was02lack02of02precaution02on02both02
sides,02however,02for02Porfiry02Petrovitch02seemed02to02be02
laughing02in02his02visitor's02face02and02to02be02very02little02disturbed02
at02the02annoyance02with02which02the02visitor02received02it.02The02
latter02fact02was02very02significant02in02Raskolnikov's02eyes:02he02
saw02that02Porfiry02Petrovitch02had02not02been02embarrassed02just02
before02either,02but02that02he,02Raskolnikov,02had02perhaps02fallen02
into02a02trap;02that02there02must02be02something,02some02motive02
here02unknown02to02him;02that,02perhaps,02everything02was02in02
readiness02and02in02another02moment02would02break02upon02him...0202
He02went02straight02to02the02point02at02once,02rose02from02his02seat02
and02took02his02cap.0202
"Porfiry02Petrovitch,"02he02began02resolutely,02though02with02
considerable02irritation,02"yesterday02you02expressed02a02desire02
that02I02should02come02to02you02for02some02inquiries"02(he02laid02
special02stress02on02the02word02"inquiries").02"I02have02come02and02if02
you02have02anything02to02ask02me,02ask02it,02and02if02not,02allow02me02to02
withdraw.02I02have02no02time02to02spare....02I02have02to02be02at02the02
funeral02of02that02man02who02was02run02over,02of02whom02you...02
know02also,"02he02added,02feeling02angry02at02once02at02having02made02
this02addition02and02more02irritated02at02his02anger.02"I02am02sick02of02
it02all,02do02you02hear?02and02have02long02been.02It's02partly02what02
made02me02ill.02In02short,"02he02shouted,02feeling02that02the02phrase02
about02his02illness02was02still02more02out02of02place,02"in02short,02
kindly02examine02me02or02let02me02go,02at02once.02And02if02you02must02

"Good02heavens!02What02do02you02mean?02What02shall02I02
question02you02about?"02cackled02Porfiry02Petrovitch02with02a02
change02of02tone,02instantly02leaving02off02laughing.02"Please02don't02
disturb02yourself,"02he02began02fidgeting02from02place02to02place02
and02fussily02making02Raskolnikov02sit02down.02"There's02no02
hurry,02there's02no02hurry,02it's02all02nonsense.02Oh,02no,02I'm02very02

Raskolnikov02did02not02speak;02he02listened,02watching02him,02
still02frowning02angrily.02He02did02sit02down,02but02still02held02his02
cap.0202"I02must02tell02you02one02thing02about02myself,02my02dear02Rodion02
Romanovitch,"02Porfiry02Petrovitch02continued,02moving02about02
the02room02and02again02avoiding02his02visitor's02eyes.02"You02see,02

wittily02and02cleverly02expressed02it02yesterday.02He02will02lie―
that02is,02the02man02who02is02a02special02case,02the02incognito,02and02he02
will02lie02well,02in02the02cleverest02fashion;02you02might02think02he02
would02triumph02and02enjoy02the02fruits02of02his02wit,02but02at02the02
most02interesting,02the02most02flagrant02moment02he02will02faint.02
Of02course02there02may02be02illness02and02a02stuffy02room02as02well,02
but02anyway!02Anyway02he's02given02us02the02idea!02He02lied02
incomparably,02but02he02didn't02reckon02on02his02temperament.02
That's02what02betrays02him!02Another02time02he02will02be02carried02
away02by02his02playful02wit02into02making02fun02of02the02man02who02
suspects02him,02he02will02turn02pale02as02it02were02on02purpose02to02
mislead,02but02his02paleness02will02be02too02natural,02too02much02like02
the02real02thing,02again02he02has02given02us02an02idea!02Though02his02
questioner02may02be02deceived02at02first,02he02will02think02
differently02next02day02if02he02is02not02a02fool,02and,02of02course,02it02is02
like02that02at02every02step!02He02puts02himself02forward02where02he02
is02not02wanted,02speaks02continually02when02he02ought02to02keep02
silent,02brings02in02all02sorts02of02allegorical02allusions,02he\he!02
Comes02and02asks02why02didn't02you02take02me02long02ago?02he\he\
he!02And02that02can02happen,02you02know,02with02the02cleverest02
man,02the02psychologist,02the02literary02man.02The02temperament02
reflects02everything02like02a02mirror!02Gaze02into02it02and02admire02
what02 you02 see!02 But02 why02 are02 you02 so02 pale,02 Rodion02
Romanovitch?02Is02the02room02stuffy?02Shall02I02open02the02
window?"0202
"Oh,02don't02trouble,02please,"02cried02Raskolnikov02and02he02
suddenly02broke02into02a02laugh.02"Please02don't02trouble."0202
Porfiry02stood02facing02him,02paused02a02moment02and02
suddenly02he02too02laughed.02Raskolnikov02got02up02from02the02
sofa,02abruptly02checking02his02hysterical02laughter.0202
"Porfiry02Petrovitch,"02he02began,02speaking02loudly02and02
distinctly,02though02his02legs02trembled02and02he02could02scarcely02
stand.02"I02see02clearly02at02last02that02you02actually02suspect02me02of02
murdering02that02old02woman02and02her02sister02Lizaveta.02Let02me02
tell02you02for02my02part02that02I02am02sick02of02this.02If02you02find02that02
you02have02a02right02to02prosecute02me02legally,02to02arrest02me,02then02
prosecute02me,02arrest02me.02But02I02will02not02let02myself02be02jeered02
at02to02my02face02and02worried..."0202
His02lips02trembled,02his02eyes02glowed02with02fury02and02he02
could02not02restrain02his02voice.0202
"I02won't02allow02it!"02he02shouted,02bringing02his02fist02down02on02
the02table.02"Do02you02hear02that,02Porfiry02Petrovitch?02I02won't02
allow02it."0202
quite02
apparently02
in02 horror,02 bringing02 his02
"Good02heavens!02What02does02it02mean?"02cried02Porfiry02
Petrovitch,02
"Rodion02
frightened.02
Romanovitch,02my02dear02fellow,02what02is02the02matter02with02
you?"0202
"I02won't02allow02it,"02Raskolnikov02shouted02again.0202
"Hush,02my02dear02man!02They'll02hear02and02come02in.02Just02
think,02what02could02we02say02to02them?"02Porfiry02Petrovitch02
whispered02
face02 close02
to02
Raskolnikov's.0202
"I02won't02allow02it,02I02won't02allow02it,"02Raskolnikov02repeated02
mechanically,02but02he02too02spoke02in02a02sudden02whisper.0202
Porfiry02turned02quickly02and02ran02to02open02the02window.0202
"Some02fresh02air!02And02you02must02have02some02water,02my02
dear02fellow.02You're02ill!"02and02he02was02running02to02the02door02to02
call02for02some02when02he02found02a02decanter02of02water02in02the02
corner.02"Come,02drink02a02little,"02he02whispered,02rushing02up02to02
him02with02the02decanter.02"It02will02be02sure02to02do02you02good."0202
Porfiry02Petrovitch's02alarm02and02sympathy02were02so02
natural02that02Raskolnikov02was02silent02and02began02looking02at02
him02with02wild02curiosity.02He02did02not02take02the02water,02
however.0202
"Rodion02Romanovitch,02my02dear02fellow,02you'll02drive02
yourself02out02of02your02mind,02I02assure02you,02ach,02ach!02Have02
some02water,02do02drink02a02little."0202
He02forced02him02to02take02the02glass.02Raskolnikov02raised02it02
mechanically02to02his02lips,02but02set02it02on02the02table02again02with02
disgust.0202
"Yes,02you've02had02a02little02attack!02You'll02bring02back02your02
illness02again,02my02dear02fellow,"02Porfiry02Petrovitch02cackled02
with02friendly02sympathy,02though02he02still02looked02rather02
disconcerted.02"Good02heavens,02you02must02take02more02care02of02
yourself!02Dmitri02Prokofitch02was02here,02came02to02see02me02
yesterday―I02know,02I02know,02I've02a02nasty,02ironical02temper,02
but02what02they02made02of02it!...02Good02heavens,02he02came02
yesterday02after02you'd02been.02We02dined02and02he02talked02and02
talked02away,02and02I02could02only02throw02up02my02hands02in02
despair!02Did02he02come02from02you?02But02do02sit02down,02for02
mercy's02sake,02sit02down!"0202
"No,02not02from02me,02but02I02knew02he02went02to02you02and02why02
he02went,"02Raskolnikov02answered02sharply.0202
"You02knew?"0202
"I02knew.02What02of02it?"0202
"Why02this,02Rodion02Romanovitch,02that02I02know02more02than02
that02about02you;02I02know02about02everything.02I02know02how02you02
went02to02take02a02flat02at02night02when02it02was02dark02and02how02you02
rang02the02bell02and02asked02about02the02blood,02so02that02the02

Please02rest,02you02look02shocking,02do02sit02down."0202
Raskolnikov02sat02down;02he02no02longer02shivered,02he02was02
hot02all02over.02In02amazement02he02listened02with02strained02
attention02to02Porfiry02Petrovitch02who02still02seemed02frightened02
as02he02looked02after02him02with02friendly02solicitude.02But02he02did02
not02believe02a02word02he02said,02though02he02felt02a02strange02
inclination02to02believe.02Porfiry's02unexpected02words02about02
the02flat02had02utterly02overwhelmed02him.02"How02can02it02be,02he02
knows02about02the02flat02then,"02he02thought02suddenly,02"and02he02
tells02it02me02himself!"0202
"Yes,02in02our02legal02practice02there02was02a02case02almost02
exactly02similar,02a02case02of02morbid02psychology,"02Porfiry02went02
on02quickly.02"A02man02confessed02to02murder02and02how02he02kept02
it02up!02It02was02a02regular02hallucination;02he02brought02forward02

illness,02 Rodion02
Romanovitch!02You02have02begun02to02neglect02your02illness.02You02
should02consult02an02experienced02doctor,02what's02the02good02of02
that02fat02fellow?02You02are02lightheaded!02You02were02delirious02
when02you02did02all02this!"0202
For02a02moment02Raskolnikov02felt02everything02going02round.0202
"Is02it02possible,02is02it02possible,"02flashed02through02his02mind,02
"that02he02is02still02lying?02He02can't02be,02he02can't02be."02He02rejected02
that02idea,02feeling02to02what02a02degree02of02fury02it02might02drive02
him,02feeling02that02that02fury02might02drive02him02mad.0202
It's02 all02
"I02was02not02delirious.02I02knew02what02I02was02doing,"02he02cried,02
straining02every02faculty02to02penetrate02Porfiry's02game,02"I02was02
quite02myself,02do02you02hear?"0202
"Yes,02I02hear02and02understand.02You02said02yesterday02you02
were02not02delirious,02you02were02particularly02emphatic02about02

business,02would02you02insist02that02you02were02not02delirious02but02
in02full02possession02of02your02faculties?02And02so02emphatically02
and02persistently?02Would02it02be02possible?02Quite02impossible,02
to02my02thinking.02If02you02had02anything02on02your02conscience,02
you02certainly02ought02to02insist02that02you02were02delirious.02
That's02so,02isn't02it?"0202
There02was02a02note02of02slyness02in02this02inquiry.02Raskolnikov02
drew02back02on02the02sofa02as02Porfiry02bent02over02him02and02stared02
in02silent02perplexity02at02him.0202
"Another02thing02about02Razumihin―you02certainly02ought02

stress02on02his02coming02at02your02instigation."0202
Raskolnikov02had02not02done02so.02A02chill02went02down02his02
back.0202"You02keep02telling02lies,"02he02said02slowly02and02weakly,02
twisting02his02lips02into02a02sickly02smile,02"you02are02trying02again02to02
show02that02you02know02all02my02game,02that02you02know02all02I02shall02

me...02or02you02are02simply02laughing02at02me..."0202
He02still02stared02at02him02as02he02said02this02and02again02there02
was02a02light02of02intense02hatred02in02his02eyes.0202
"You02keep02lying,"02he02said.02"You02know02perfectly02well02that02
the02best02policy02for02the02criminal02is02to02tell02the02truth02as02nearly02

"What02a02wily02person02you02are!"02Porfiry02tittered,02"there's02

"Yes,02I02do,"02went02on02Porfiry,02touching02Raskolnikov's02arm02
genially,02"you02must02take02care02of02your02illness.02Besides,02your02

Raskolnikov02started02so02that02Porfiry02Petrovitch02could02
not02fail02to02perceive02it.0202
"You02are02lying02all02the02while,"02he02cried,02"I02don't02know02

he!"0202Raskolnikov02looked02haughtily02and02contemptuously02at02
him.0202"Briefly,"02he02said02loudly02and02imperiously,02rising02to02his02
feet02and02in02so02doing02pushing02Porfiry02back02a02little,02"briefly,02I02
want02to02know,02do02you02acknowledge02me02perfectly02free02from02

for02all02and02make02haste!"0202
"What02a02business02I'm02having02with02you!"02cried02Porfiry02
with02a02perfectly02good\humoured,02sly02and02composed02face.02
"And02why02do02you02want02to02know,02why02do02you02want02to02know02
so02much,02since02they02haven't02begun02to02worry02you?02Why,02you02
are02like02a02child02asking02for02matches!02And02why02are02you02so02
uneasy?02Why02do02you02force02yourself02upon02us,02eh?02He\he\
he!"0202"I02repeat,"02Raskolnikov02cried02furiously,02"that02I02can't02put02
up02with02it!"0202
"With02what?02Uncertainty?"02interrupted02Porfiry.0202
"Don't02jeer02at02me!02I02won't02have02it!02I02tell02you02I02won't02have02
it.02I02can't02and02I02won't,02do02you02hear,02do02you02hear?"02he02
shouted,02bringing02his02fist02down02on02the02table02again.0202
"Hush!02Hush!02They'll02overhear!02I02warn02you02seriously,02
take02care02of02yourself.02I02am02not02joking,"02Porfiry02whispered,02
but02this02time02there02was02not02the02look02of02old02womanish02good02
nature02and02alarm02in02his02face.02Now02he02was02peremptory,02
stern,02frowning02and02for02once02laying02aside02all02mystification.0202
instant.02 Raskolnikov,02
But02 this02 was02 only02
bewildered,02suddenly02fell02into02actual02frenzy,02but,02strange02to02
say,02he02again02obeyed02the02command02to02speak02quietly,02
though02he02was02in02a02perfect02paroxysm02of02fury.0202
"I02will02not02allow02myself02to02be02tortured,"02he02whispered,02
instantly02recognising02with02hatred02that02he02could02not02help02
obeying02the02command02and02driven02to02even02greater02fury02by02
the02thought.02"Arrest02me,02search02me,02but02kindly02act02in02due02
form02and02don't02play02with02me!02Don't02dare!"0202
"Don't02worry02about02the02form,"02Porfiry02interrupted02with02
the02same02sly02smile,02as02it02were,02gloating02with02enjoyment02
over02Raskolnikov.02"I02invited02you02to02see02me02quite02in02a02
friendly02way."0202
for02 an02
"I02don't02want02your02friendship02and02I02spit02on02it!02Do02you02
hear?02And,02here,02I02take02my02cap02and02go.02What02will02you02say02
now02if02you02mean02to02arrest02me?"0202
He02took02up02his02cap02and02went02to02the02door.0202
"And02won't02you02see02my02little02surprise?"02chuckled02
Porfiry,02again02taking02him02by02the02arm02and02stopping02him02at02
the02door.0202
He02 seemed02 to02 become02 more02 playful02 and02 good\
humoured02which02maddened02Raskolnikov.0202
"What02surprise?"02he02asked,02standing02still02and02looking02at02
Porfiry02in02alarm.0202
"My02little02surprise,02it's02sitting02there02behind02the02door,02he\
he\he!"02(He02pointed02to02the02locked02door.)02"I02locked02him02in02
that02he02should02not02escape."0202
"What02is02it?02Where?02What?..."0202
Raskolnikov02walked02to02the02door02and02would02have02
opened02it,02but02it02was02locked.0202
"It's02locked,02here02is02the02key!"0202
And02he02brought02a02key02out02of02his02pocket.0202
"You02are02lying,"02roared02Raskolnikov02without02restraint,02
"you02lie,02you02damned02punchinello!"02and02he02rushed02at02
Porfiry02who02retreated02to02the02other02door,02not02at02all02alarmed.0202
"I02understand02it02all!02You02are02lying02and02mocking02so02that02I02
may02betray02myself02to02you..."0202
"Why,02you02could02not02betray02yourself02any02further,02my02
dear02Rodion02Romanovitch.02You02are02in02a02passion.02Don't02
shout,02I02shall02call02the02clerks."0202
"You02are02lying!02Call02the02clerks!02You02knew02I02was02ill02and02
tried02to02work02me02into02a02frenzy02to02make02me02betray02myself,02
that02was02your02object!02Produce02your02facts!02I02understand02it02
all.02You've02no02evidence,02you02have02only02wretched02rubbishly02
suspicions02like02Zametov's!02You02knew02my02character,02you02
wanted02to02drive02me02to02fury02and02then02to02knock02me02down02
with02priests02and02deputies....02Are02you02waiting02for02them?02eh!02
What02are02you02waiting02for?02Where02are02they?02Produce02
them?"0202
"Why02deputies,02my02good02man?02What02things02people02will02
imagine!02And02to02do02so02would02not02be02acting02in02form02as02you02
say,02you02don't02know02the02business,02my02dear02fellow....02And02
there's02no02escaping02form,02as02you02see,"02Porfiry02muttered,02
listening02at02the02door02through02which02a02noise02could02be02heard.0202
"Ah,02they're02coming,"02cried02Raskolnikov.02"You've02sent02
for02them!02You02expected02them!02Well,02produce02them02all:02your02
deputies,02your02witnesses,02what02you02like!...02I02am02ready!"0202
But02at02this02moment02a02strange02incident02occurred,02
something02so02unexpected02that02neither02Raskolnikov02nor02
Porfiry02Petrovitch02could02have02looked02for02such02a02conclusion02
to02their02interview.0202
02
0202
WHEN02HE02REMEMBERED02THE02SCENE02
AFTERWARDS,02THIS02IS02HOW02RASKOLNIKOV02SAW02IT.0202
The02noise02behind02the02door02increased,02and02suddenly02the02
door02was02opened02a02little.0202
"What02is02it?"02cried02Porfiry02Petrovitch,02annoyed.02"Why,02I02
gave02orders..."0202
For02an02instant02there02was02no02answer,02but02it02was02evident02
that02there02were02several02persons02at02the02door,02and02that02they02
were02apparently02pushing02somebody02back.0202
CHAPTER02VI0202
"What02is02it?"02Porfiry02Petrovitch02repeated,02uneasily.0202
"The02prisoner02Nikolay02has02been02brought,"02someone02
answered.0202
"He02is02not02wanted!02Take02him02away!02Let02him02wait!02
What's02he02doing02here?02How02irregular!"02cried02Porfiry,02
rushing02to02the02door.0202
"But02he..."02began02the02same02voice,02and02suddenly02ceased.0202
Two02seconds,02not02more,02were02spent02in02actual02struggle,02
then02someone02gave02a02violent02shove,02and02then02a02man,02very02
pale,02strode02into02the02room.0202
This02man's02appearance02was02at02first02sight02very02strange.02
He02stared02straight02before02him,02as02though02seeing02nothing.02
There02was02a02determined02gleam02in02his02eyes;02at02the02same02
time02there02was02a02deathly02pallor02in02his02face,02as02though02he02
were02being02led02to02the02scaffold.02His02white02lips02were02faintly02
twitching.0202
He02was02dressed02like02a02workman02and02was02of02medium02
height,02very02young,02slim,02his02hair02cut02in02round02crop,02with02
thin02spare02features.02The02man02whom02he02had02thrust02back02
followed02him02into02the02room02and02succeeded02in02seizing02him02
by02the02shoulder;02he02was02a02warder;02but02Nikolay02pulled02his02
arm02away.0202
Several02 persons02 crowded02
into02
the02
doorway.02Some02of02them02tried02to02get02in.02All02this02took02place02
almost02instantaneously.0202
"Go02away,02it's02too02soon!02Wait02till02you02are02sent02for!...02Why02
have02you02brought02him02so02soon?"02Porfiry02Petrovitch02
muttered,02extremely02annoyed,02and02as02it02were02thrown02out02
of02his02reckoning.0202
But02Nikolay02suddenly02knelt02down.0202
"What's02the02matter?"02cried02Porfiry,02surprised.0202
inquisitively02
"I02am02guilty!02Mine02is02the02sin!02I02am02the02murderer,"02
Nikolay02 articulated02 suddenly,02 rather02 breathless,02 but02
speaking02fairly02loudly.0202
For02ten02seconds02there02was02silence02as02though02all02had02
been02struck02dumb;02even02the02warder02stepped02back,02
mechanically02retreated02to02the02door,02and02stood02immovable.0202
"What02is02it?"02cried02Porfiry02Petrovitch,02recovering02from02
his02momentary02stupefaction.0202
"I...02am02the02murderer,"02repeated02Nikolay,02after02a02brief02
pause.0202
"What...02you...02what...02whom02did02you02kill?"02Porfiry02
Petrovitch02was02obviously02bewildered.0202
Nikolay02again02was02silent02for02a02moment.0202
"Alyona02Ivanovna02and02her02sister02Lizaveta02Ivanovna,02I...02
killed...02with02an02axe.02Darkness02came02over02me,"02he02added02
suddenly,02and02was02again02silent.0202
He02still02remained02on02his02knees.02Porfiry02Petrovitch02stood02
for02some02moments02as02though02meditating,02but02suddenly02
roused02himself02and02waved02back02the02uninvited02spectators.02
They02instantly02vanished02and02closed02the02door.02Then02he02
looked02towards02Raskolnikov,02who02was02standing02in02the02
corner,02staring02wildly02at02Nikolay02and02moved02towards02him,02
but02stopped02short,02looked02from02Nikolay02to02Raskolnikov02
and02then02again02at02Nikolay,02and02seeming02unable02to02restrain02
himself02darted02at02the02latter.0202
"You're02in02too02great02a02hurry,"02he02shouted02at02him,02almost02
angrily.02"I02didn't02ask02you02what02came02over02you....02Speak,02did02
you02kill02them?"0202
"I02am02the02murderer....02I02want02to02give02evidence,"02Nikolay02
pronounced.0202
"Ach!02What02did02you02kill02them02with?"0202
"An02axe.02I02had02it02ready."0202
"Ach,02he02is02in02a02hurry!02Alone?"0202
Nikolay02did02not02understand02the02question.0202
"Did02you02do02it02alone?"0202
"Yes,02alone.02And02Mitka02is02not02guilty02and02had02no02share02in02
it."0202"Don't02be02in02a02hurry02about02Mitka!02A\ach!02How02was02it02you02
ran02downstairs02like02that02at02the02time?02The02porters02met02you02
both!"0202
"It02was02to02put02them02off02the02scent...02I02ran02after02Mitka,"02
Nikolay02replied02hurriedly,02as02though02he02had02prepared02the02
answer.0202
"I02knew02it!"02cried02Porfiry,02with02vexation.02"It's02not02his02
own02tale02he02is02telling,"02he02muttered02as02though02to02himself,02
and02suddenly02his02eyes02rested02on02Raskolnikov02again.0202
He02was02apparently02so02taken02up02with02Nikolay02that02for02a02
moment02he02had02forgotten02Raskolnikov.02He02was02a02little02
taken02aback.0202
"My02dear02Rodion02Romanovitch,02excuse02me!"02he02flew02up02
to02him,02"this02won't02do;02I'm02afraid02you02must02go...02it's02no02good02
your02staying...02I02will...02you02see,02what02a02surprise!...02Good\
bye!"0202And02taking02him02by02the02arm,02he02showed02him02to02the02door.0202
"I02suppose02you02didn't02expect02it?"02said02Raskolnikov02who,02
though02he02had02not02yet02fully02grasped02the02situation,02had02
regained02his02courage.0202
"You02did02not02expect02it02either,02my02friend.02See02how02your02
hand02is02trembling!02He\he!"0202
"You're02trembling,02too,02Porfiry02Petrovitch!"0202
"Yes,02I02am;02I02didn't02expect02it."0202
They02were02already02at02the02door;02Porfiry02was02impatient02
for02Raskolnikov02to02be02gone.0202
"And02your02little02surprise,02aren't02you02going02to02show02it02to02
me?"02Raskolnikov02said,02sarcastically.0202
"Why,02his02teeth02are02chattering02as02he02asks,02he\he!02You02
are02an02ironical02person!02Come,02till02we02meet!"0202
"I02believe02we02can02say02good02bye!"0202
"That's02in02God's02hands,"02muttered02Porfiry,02with02an02
unnatural02smile.0202
As02he02walked02through02the02office,02Raskolnikov02noticed02
that02many02people02were02looking02at02him.02Among02them02he02
saw02the02two02porters02from02the02house,02whom02he02had02invited02
that02night02to02the02police02station.02They02stood02there02waiting.02
But02he02was02no02sooner02on02the02stairs02than02he02heard02the02voice02
of02Porfiry02Petrovitch02behind02him.02Turning02round,02he02saw02
the02latter02running02after02him,02out02of02breath.0202
"One02word,02Rodion02Romanovitch;02as02to02all02the02rest,02it's02
in02God's02hands,02but02as02a02matter02of02form02there02are02some02
questions02I02shall02have02to02ask02you...02so02we02shall02meet02again,02
shan't02we?"0202
And02Porfiry02stood02still,02facing02him02with02a02smile.0202
"Shan't02we?"02he02added02again.0202
He02seemed02to02want02to02say02something02more,02but02could02
not02speak02out.0202
"You02must02forgive02me,02Porfiry02Petrovitch,02for02what02has02
just02passed...02I02lost02my02temper,"02began02Raskolnikov,02who02
had02so02far02regained02his02courage02that02he02felt02irresistibly02
inclined02to02display02his02coolness.0202
"Don't02mention02it,02don't02mention02it,"02Porfiry02replied,02
almost02gleefully.02"I02myself,02too...02I02have02a02wicked02temper,02I02
admit02it!02But02we02shall02meet02again.02If02it's02God's02will,02we02may02
see02a02great02deal02of02one02another."0202
"And02will02get02to02know02each02other02through02and02
through?"02added02Raskolnikov.0202
"Yes;02know02each02other02through02and02through,"02assented02
Porfiry02Petrovitch,02and02he02screwed02up02his02eyes,02looking02
earnestly02at02Raskolnikov.02"Now02you're02going02to02a02birthday02
party?"0202
"To02a02funeral."0202
"Of02course,02the02funeral!02Take02care02of02yourself,02and02get02
well."0202
"I02don't02know02what02to02wish02you,"02said02Raskolnikov,02who02
had02begun02to02descend02the02stairs,02but02looked02back02again.02"I02
should02like02to02wish02you02success,02but02your02office02is02such02a02
comical02one."0202
"Why02comical?"02Porfiry02Petrovitch02had02turned02to02go,02but02
he02seemed02to02prick02up02his02ears02at02this.0202
"Why,02how02you02must02have02been02torturing02and02harassing02
that02poor02Nikolay02psychologically,02after02your02fashion,02till02
he02confessed!02You02must02have02been02at02him02day02and02night,02
proving02to02him02that02he02was02the02murderer,02and02now02that02he02
has02confessed,02you'll02begin02vivisecting02him02again.02'You02are02
lying,'02you'll02say.02'You02are02not02the02murderer!02You02can't02be!02
It's02not02your02own02tale02you02are02telling!'02You02must02admit02it's02
a02comical02business!"0202
"He\he\he!02You02noticed02then02that02I02said02to02Nikolay02just02
now02that02it02was02not02his02own02tale02he02was02telling?"0202
"How02could02I02help02noticing02it!"0202
"He\he!02You02are02quick\witted.02You02notice02everything!02
You've02really02a02playful02mind!02And02you02always02fasten02on02the02
comic02side...02he\he!02They02say02that02was02the02marked02
characteristic02of02Gogol,02among02the02writers."0202
"Yes,02of02Gogol."0202
"Yes,02of02Gogol....02I02shall02look02forward02to02meeting02you."0202
"So02shall02I."0202
Raskolnikov02walked02straight02home.02He02was02so02muddled02
and02bewildered02that02on02getting02home02he02sat02for02a02quarter02
of02an02hour02on02the02sofa,02trying02to02collect02his02thoughts.02He02did02
not02attempt02to02think02about02Nikolay;02he02was02stupefied;02he02
have02
felt02that02his02confession02was02something02inexplicable,02
amazing―something02 beyond02 his02 understanding.02 But02
Nikolay's02confession02was02an02actual02fact.02The02consequences02
of02this02fact02were02clear02to02him02at02once,02its02falsehood02could02
not02fail02to02be02discovered,02and02then02they02would02be02after02him02
again.02Till02then,02at02least,02he02was02free02and02must02do02
something02for02himself,02for02the02danger02was02imminent.0202
But02how02imminent?02His02position02gradually02became02
clear02to02him.02Remembering,02sketchily,02the02main02outlines02of02
his02 recent02 scene02 with02 Porfiry,02 he02 could02 not02 help02
shuddering02again02with02horror.02Of02course,02he02did02not02yet02
know02all02Porfiry's02aims,02he02could02not02see02into02all02his02
calculations.02But02he02had02already02partly02shown02his02hand,02
and02no02one02knew02better02than02Raskolnikov02how02terrible02
Porfiry's02"lead"02had02been02for02him.02A02little02more02and02he02
might02
completely,02
circumstantially.02Knowing02his02nervous02temperament02and02
from02the02first02glance02seeing02through02him,02Porfiry,02though02
playing02a02bold02game,02was02bound02to02win.02There's02no02
denying02 that02 Raskolnikov02 had02 compromised02 himself02
seriously,02but02no02facts02had02come02to02light02as02yet;02there02was02
nothing02positive.02But02was02he02taking02a02true02view02of02the02
position?02Wasn't02he02mistaken?02What02had02Porfiry02been02
trying02to02get02at?02Had02he02really02some02surprise02prepared02for02
him?02And02what02was02it?02Had02he02really02been02expecting02
something02or02not?02How02would02they02have02parted02if02it02had02
not02been02for02the02unexpected02appearance02of02Nikolay?0202
Porfiry02had02shown02almost02all02his02cards―of02course,02he02
had02risked02something02in02showing02them―and02if02he02had02
really02had02anything02up02his02sleeve02(Raskolnikov02reflected),02
he02would02have02shown02that,02too.02What02was02that02"surprise"?02
Was02it02a02joke?02Had02it02meant02anything?02Could02it02have02
concealed02anything02like02a02fact,02a02piece02of02positive02evidence?02
himself02
given02
away02
His02yesterday's02visitor?02What02had02become02of02him?02Where02
was02he02to\day?02If02Porfiry02really02had02any02evidence,02it02must02
be02connected02with02him....0202
He02sat02on02the02sofa02with02his02elbows02on02his02knees02and02his02
face02hidden02in02his02hands.02He02was02still02shivering02nervously.02
At02last02he02got02up,02took02his02cap,02thought02a02minute,02and02went02
to02the02door.0202
He02had02a02sort02of02presentiment02that02for02to\day,02at02least,02
he02might02consider02himself02out02of02danger.02He02had02a02sudden02
sense02almost02of02joy;02he02wanted02to02make02haste02to02Katerina02
Ivanovna's.02He02would02be02too02late02for02the02funeral,02of02course,02
but02he02would02be02in02time02for02the02memorial02dinner,02and02
there02at02once02he02would02see02Sonia.0202
He02stood02still,02thought02a02moment,02and02a02suffering02smile02
came02for02a02moment02on02to02his02lips.0202
"To\day!02To\day,"02he02repeated02to02himself.02"Yes,02to\day!02
So02it02must02be...."0202
But02as02he02was02about02to02open02the02door,02it02began02opening02
of02itself.02He02started02and02moved02back.02The02door02opened02
gently02and02slowly,02and02there02suddenly02appeared02a02figure―
yesterday's02visitor02from02underground.0202
The02man02stood02in02the02doorway,02looked02at02Raskolnikov02
without02speaking,02and02took02a02step02forward02into02the02room.02
He02was02exactly02the02same02as02yesterday;02the02same02figure,02the02
same02dress,02but02there02was02a02great02change02in02his02face;02he02
looked02dejected02and02sighed02deeply.02If02he02had02only02put02his02
hand02up02to02his02cheek02and02leaned02his02head02on02one02side02he02
would02have02looked02exactly02like02a02peasant02woman.0202
"What02do02you02want?"02asked02Raskolnikov,02numb02with02
terror.02The02man02was02still02silent,02but02suddenly02he02bowed02
down02almost02to02the02ground,02touching02it02with02his02finger.0202
"What02is02it?"02cried02Raskolnikov.0202
"I02have02sinned,"02the02man02articulated02softly.0202
interrupted,02
"How?"0202
"By02evil02thoughts."0202
They02looked02at02one02another.0202
"I02was02vexed.02When02you02came,02perhaps02in02drink,02and02
bade02the02porters02go02to02the02police02station02and02asked02about02
the02blood,02I02was02vexed02that02they02let02you02go02and02took02you02
for02drunken.02I02was02so02vexed02that02I02lost02my02sleep.02And02
remembering02the02address02we02came02here02yesterday02and02
asked02for02you...."0202
instantly02
"Who02 came?"02 Raskolnikov02
beginning02to02recollect.0202
"I02did,02I've02wronged02you."0202
"Then02you02come02from02that02house?"0202
"I02was02standing02at02the02gate02with02them...02don't02you02
remember?02We02have02carried02on02our02trade02in02that02house02for02
years02past.02We02cure02and02prepare02hides,02we02take02work02
home...02most02of02all02I02was02vexed...."0202
And02the02whole02scene02of02the02day02before02yesterday02in02the02
gateway02came02clearly02before02Raskolnikov's02mind;02he02
recollected02that02there02had02been02several02people02there02
besides02the02porters,02women02among02them.02He02remembered02
one02voice02had02suggested02taking02him02straight02to02the02police\
station.02He02could02not02recall02the02face02of02the02speaker,02and02
even02now02he02did02not02recognise02it,02but02he02remembered02that02
he02had02turned02round02and02made02him02some02answer....0202
So02this02was02the02solution02of02yesterday's02horror.02The02most02
awful02thought02was02that02he02had02been02actually02almost02lost,02
had02almost02done02for02himself02on02account02of02such02a02 trivial02
circumstance.02So02this02man02could02tell02nothing02except02his02
asking02about02the02flat02and02the02blood02stains.02So02Porfiry,02too,02
had02nothing02but02that02delirium,02no02facts02but02this02psychology02
which02cuts02both02ways,02nothing02positive.02So02if02no02more02facts02
come02to02light02(and02they02must02not,02they02must02not!)02then...02
then02what02can02they02do02to02him?02How02can02they02convict02him,02
even02if02they02arrest02him?02And02Porfiry02then02had02only02just02
heard02about02the02flat02and02had02not02known02about02it02before.0202
"Was02it02you02who02told02Porfiry...02that02I'd02been02there?"02he02
cried,02struck02by02a02sudden02idea.0202
"What02Porfiry?"0202
"The02head02of02the02detective02department?"0202
"Yes.02The02porters02did02not02go02there,02but02I02went."0202
"To\day?"0202
"I02got02there02two02minutes02before02you.02And02I02heard,02I02
heard02it02all,02how02he02worried02you."0202
"Where?02What?02When?"0202
"Why,02in02the02next02room.02I02was02sitting02there02all02the02time."0202
"What?02Why,02then02you02were02the02surprise?02But02how02
could02it02happen?02Upon02my02word!"0202
"I02saw02that02the02porters02did02not02want02to02do02what02I02said,"02
began02the02man;02"for02it's02too02late,02said02they,02and02maybe02he'll02
be02angry02that02we02did02not02come02at02the02time.02I02was02vexed02and02
I02lost02my02sleep,02and02I02began02making02inquiries.02And02finding02
out02yesterday02where02to02go,02I02went02to\day.02The02first02time02I02
went02he02wasn't02there,02when02I02came02an02hour02later02he02
couldn't02see02me.02I02went02the02third02time,02and02they02showed02
me02in.02I02informed02him02of02everything,02just02as02it02happened,02
and02he02began02skipping02about02the02room02and02punching02
himself02on02the02chest.02'What02do02you02scoundrels02mean02by02it?02
If02I'd02known02about02it02I02should02have02arrested02him!'02Then02he02
ran02out,02called02somebody02and02began02talking02to02him02in02the02
corner,02then02he02turned02to02me,02scolding02and02questioning02me.02
He02scolded02me02a02great02deal;02and02I02told02him02everything,02and02
I02told02him02that02you02didn't02dare02to02say02a02word02in02answer02to02
me02yesterday02and02that02you02didn't02recognise02me.02And02he02fell02
to02running02about02again02and02kept02hitting02himself02on02the02
chest,02and02getting02angry02and02running02about,02and02when02you02
were02announced02he02told02me02to02go02into02the02next02room.02'Sit02
there02a02bit,'02he02said.02'Don't02move,02whatever02you02may02hear.'02
And02he02set02a02chair02there02for02me02and02locked02me02in.02
'Perhaps,'02he02said,02'I02may02call02you.'02And02when02Nikolay'd02
been02brought02he02let02me02out02as02soon02as02you02were02gone.02'I02
shall02send02for02you02again02and02question02you,'02he02said."0202
"And02did02he02question02Nikolay02while02you02were02there?"0202
"He02got02rid02of02me02as02he02did02of02you,02before02he02spoke02to02
Nikolay."0202
The02man02stood02still,02and02again02suddenly02bowed02down,02
touching02the02ground02with02his02finger.0202
"Forgive02me02for02my02evil02thoughts,02and02my02slander."0202
"May02God02forgive02you,"02answered02Raskolnikov.0202
And02as02he02said02this,02the02man02bowed02down02again,02but02not02
to02the02ground,02turned02slowly02and02went02out02of02the02room.0202
"It02all02cuts02both02ways,02now02it02all02cuts02both02ways,"02
repeated02Raskolnikov,02and02he02went02out02more02confident02
than02ever.0202
"Now02we'll02make02a02fight02for02it,"02he02said,02with02a02malicious02
smile,02as02he02went02down02the02stairs.02His02malice02was02aimed02at02
himself;02with02shame02and02contempt02he02recollected02his02
"cowardice."0202

CHAPTER02I0202
02
0202
The02morning02that02followed02the02fateful02interview02with02
Dounia02and02her02mother02brought02sobering02influences02to02
bear02on02Pyotr02Petrovitch.02Intensely02unpleasant02as02it02was,02
he02was02forced02little02by02little02to02accept02as02a02fact02beyond02
recall02what02had02seemed02to02him02only02the02day02before02
fantastic02and02incredible.02The02black02snake02of02wounded02
vanity02had02been02gnawing02at02his02heart02all02night.02When02he02
got02out02of02bed,02Pyotr02Petrovitch02immediately02looked02in02the02
looking\glass.02 He02 was02 afraid02 that02 he02 had02
jaundice.02
However02his02health02seemed02unimpaired02so02far,02and02looking02
at02his02noble,02clear\skinned02countenance02which02had02grown02
fattish02of02late,02Pyotr02Petrovitch02for02an02instant02was02
positively02comforted02in02the02conviction02that02he02would02find02
another02bride02and,02perhaps,02even02a02better02one.02But02coming02
back02to02the02sense02of02his02present02position,02he02turned02aside02
and02spat02vigorously,02which02excited02a02sarcastic02smile02in02
Andrey02Semyonovitch02Lebeziatnikov,02the02young02friend02
with02whom02he02was02staying.02That02smile02Pyotr02Petrovitch02
noticed,02and02at02once02set02it02down02against02his02young02friend's02
account.02He02had02set02down02a02good02many02points02against02him02
of02late.02His02anger02was02redoubled02when02he02reflected02that02he02
ought02not02to02have02told02Andrey02Semyonovitch02about02the02
result02of02yesterday's02interview.02That02was02the02second02
mistake02he02had02made02in02temper,02through02impulsiveness02
and02
irritability....02 Moreover,02 all02
that02 morning02 one02
unpleasantness02followed02another.02He02even02found02a02hitch02
awaiting02him02in02his02legal02case02in02the02senate.02He02was02
particularly02irritated02by02the02owner02of02the02flat02which02had02
been02taken02in02view02of02his02approaching02marriage02and02was02
being02redecorated02at02his02own02expense;02the02owner,02a02rich02
German02tradesman,02would02not02entertain02the02idea02of02
breaking02the02contract02which02had02just02been02signed02and02
insisted02on02the02full02forfeit02money,02though02Pyotr02Petrovitch02
would02be02giving02him02back02the02flat02practically02redecorated.02
In02the02same02way02the02upholsterers02refused02to02return02a02
single02rouble02of02the02instalment02paid02for02the02furniture02
purchased02but02not02yet02removed02to02the02flat.0202
"Am02I02to02get02married02simply02for02the02sake02of02the02
furniture?"02Pyotr02Petrovitch02ground02his02teeth02and02at02the02
same02time02once02more02he02had02a02gleam02of02desperate02hope.02
"Can02all02that02be02really02so02irrevocably02over?02Is02it02no02use02to02
make02another02effort?"02The02thought02of02Dounia02sent02a02
voluptuous02pang02through02his02heart.02He02endured02anguish02at02
that02moment,02and02if02it02had02been02possible02to02slay02
Raskolnikov02instantly02by02wishing02it,02Pyotr02Petrovitch02
would02promptly02have02uttered02the02wish.0202
"It02was02my02mistake,02too,02not02to02have02given02them02
money,"02 he02 thought,02 as02 he02 returned02 dejectedly02 to02
Lebeziatnikov's02room,02"and02why02on02earth02was02I02such02a02
Jew?02It02was02false02economy!02I02meant02to02keep02them02without02a02
penny02so02that02they02should02turn02to02me02as02their02providence,02
and02look02at02them!02foo!02If02I'd02spent02some02fifteen02hundred02
roubles02on02them02for02the02trousseau02and02presents,02on02knick\
knacks,02dressing\cases,02jewellery,02materials,02and02all02that02
sort02of02trash02from02Knopp's02and02the02English02shop,02my02
position02would02have02been02better02and...02stronger!02They02
could02not02have02refused02me02so02easily!02They02are02the02sort02of02
people02that02would02feel02bound02to02return02money02and02
presents02if02they02broke02it02off;02and02they02would02find02it02hard02to02
do02it!02And02their02conscience02would02prick02them:02how02can02we02
dismiss02a02man02who02has02hitherto02been02so02generous02and02
delicate?....02H'm!02I've02made02a02blunder."0202
And02grinding02his02teeth02again,02Pyotr02Petrovitch02called02
himself02a02fool―but02not02aloud,02of02course.0202
He02returned02home,02twice02as02irritated02and02angry02as02
before.02The02preparations02for02the02funeral02dinner02at02Katerina02
Ivanovna's02excited02his02curiosity02as02he02passed.02He02had02
heard02about02it02the02day02before;02he02fancied,02indeed,02that02he02
had02been02invited,02but02absorbed02in02his02own02cares02he02had02
paid02no02attention.02Inquiring02of02Madame02Lippevechsel02who02
was02busy02laying02the02table02while02Katerina02Ivanovna02was02
away02at02the02cemetery,02he02heard02that02the02entertainment02
was02to02be02a02great02affair,02that02all02the02lodgers02had02been02
invited,02among02them02some02who02had02not02known02the02dead02
man,02that02even02Andrey02Semyonovitch02Lebeziatnikov02was02
invited02in02spite02of02his02previous02quarrel02with02Katerina02
Ivanovna,02that02he,02Pyotr02Petrovitch,02was02not02only02invited,02
but02was02eagerly02expected02as02he02was02the02most02important02of02
the02lodgers.02Amalia02Ivanovna02herself02had02been02invited02with02
great02ceremony02in02spite02of02the02recent02unpleasantness,02and02
so02she02was02very02busy02with02preparations02and02was02taking02a02
positive02pleasure02in02them;02she02was02moreover02dressed02up02
to02the02nines,02all02in02new02black02silk,02and02she02was02proud02of02it.02
All02this02suggested02an02idea02to02Pyotr02Petrovitch02and02he02went02
into02his02room,02or02rather02Lebeziatnikov's,02somewhat02
thoughtful.02He02had02learnt02that02Raskolnikov02was02to02be02one02
of02the02guests.0202
Andrey02Semyonovitch02had02been02at02home02all02the02
morning.02 The02 attitude02 of02 Pyotr02 Petrovitch02 to02 this02
gentleman02was02strange,02though02perhaps02natural.02Pyotr02
Petrovitch02had02despised02and02hated02him02from02the02day02he02
came02to02stay02with02him02and02at02the02same02time02he02seemed02
somewhat02afraid02of02him.02He02had02not02come02to02stay02with02him02
on02his02arrival02in02Petersburg02simply02from02parsimony,02
though02that02had02been02perhaps02his02chief02object.02He02had02
heard02of02Andrey02Semyonovitch,02who02had02once02been02his02
ward,02as02a02leading02young02progressive02who02was02taking02an02
important02part02in02certain02interesting02circles,02the02doings02of02
which02were02a02legend02in02the02provinces.02It02had02impressed02
Pyotr02Petrovitch.02These02powerful02omniscient02circles02who02
despised02everyone02and02showed02everyone02up02had02long02
inspired02in02him02a02peculiar02but02quite02vague02alarm.02He02had02
not,02of02course,02been02able02to02form02even02an02approximate02
notion02of02what02they02meant.02He,02like02everyone,02had02heard02
that02there02were,02especially02in02Petersburg,02progressives02of02
some02sort,02nihilists02and02so02on,02and,02like02many02people,02he02
exaggerated02and02distorted02the02significance02of02those02words02
to02an02absurd02degree.02What02for02many02years02past02he02had02
feared02more02than02anything02was02 being02shown02up02and02this02
was02the02chief02ground02for02his02continual02uneasiness02at02the02
thought02of02transferring02his02business02to02Petersburg.02He02was02
afraid02of02this02as02little02children02are02sometimes02panic\
stricken.02Some02years02before,02when02he02was02just02entering02on02
his02own02career,02he02had02come02upon02two02cases02in02which02
rather02important02personages02in02the02province,02patrons02of02
his,02had02been02cruelly02shown02up.02One02instance02had02ended02in02
great02scandal02for02the02person02attacked02and02the02other02had02
very02nearly02ended02in02serious02trouble.02For02this02reason02Pyotr02
Petrovitch02intended02to02go02into02the02subject02as02soon02as02he02
reached02 Petersburg02 and,02
if02 necessary,02 to02 anticipate02
contingencies02by02seeking02the02favour02of02"our02younger02
generation."02He02relied02on02Andrey02Semyonovitch02for02this02
and02before02his02visit02to02Raskolnikov02he02had02succeeded02in02
picking02up02some02current02phrases.02He02soon02discovered02that02
Andrey02Semyonovitch02was02a02commonplace02simpleton,02but02
that02by02no02means02reassured02Pyotr02Petrovitch.02Even02if02he02
had02been02certain02that02all02the02progressives02were02fools02like02
him,02it02would02not02have02allayed02his02uneasiness.02All02the02
doctrines,02the02ideas,02the02systems,02with02which02Andrey02
Semyonovitch02pestered02him02had02no02interest02for02him.02He02
had02his02own02object―he02simply02wanted02to02find02out02at02once02
what02was02happening02here.02Had02these02people02any02power02or02
not?02Had02he02anything02to02fear02from02them?02Would02they02
expose02any02enterprise02of02his?02And02what02precisely02was02now02
the02object02of02their02attacks?02Could02he02somehow02make02up02to02
them02and02get02round02them02if02they02really02were02powerful?02
Was02this02the02thing02to02do02or02not?02Couldn't02he02gain02
something02through02them?02In02fact02hundreds02of02questions02
presented02themselves.0202
Andrey02Semyonovitch02was02an02an03mic,02scrofulous02little02
man,02with02strangely02flaxen02mutton\chop02whiskers02of02which02
he02was02very02proud.02He02was02a02clerk02and02had02almost02always02
something02wrong02with02his02eyes.02He02was02rather02soft\
hearted,02but02self\confident02and02sometimes02extremely02
conceited02
in02 speech,02 which02 had02 an02 absurd02 effect,02
incongruous02with02his02little02figure.02He02was02one02of02the02
lodgers02most02respected02by02Amalia02Ivanovna,02for02he02did02not02
get02drunk02and02paid02regularly02for02his02lodgings.02Andrey02
Semyonovitch02really02was02rather02stupid;02he02attached02
himself02to02the02cause02of02progress02and02"our02younger02
generation"02from02enthusiasm.02He02was02one02of02the02numerous02
and02varied02legion02of02dullards,02of02half\animate02abortions,02
conceited,02half\educated02coxcombs,02who02attach02themselves02
to02the02idea02most02in02fashion02only02to02vulgarise02it02and02who02
caricature02every02cause02they02serve,02however02sincerely.0202
Though02Lebeziatnikov02was02so02good\natured,02he,02too,02
was02beginning02to02dislike02Pyotr02Petrovitch.02This02happened02
on02both02sides02unconsciously.02However02simple02Andrey02
Semyonovitch02might02be,02he02began02to02see02that02Pyotr02
Petrovitch02was02duping02him02and02secretly02despising02him,02
and02that02"he02was02not02the02right02sort02of02man."02He02had02tried02
expounding02to02him02the02system02of02Fourier02and02the02
Darwinian02theory,02but02of02late02Pyotr02Petrovitch02began02to02
listen02too02sarcastically02and02even02to02be02rude.02The02fact02was02
he02had02begun02instinctively02to02guess02that02Lebeziatnikov02was02
not02merely02a02commonplace02simpleton,02but,02perhaps,02a02liar,02
too,02and02that02he02had02no02connections02of02any02consequence02
even02in02his02own02circle,02but02had02simply02picked02things02up02
third\hand;02and02that02very02likely02he02did02not02even02know02
much02about02his02own02work02of02propaganda,02for02he02was02in02too02
great02a02muddle.02A02fine02person02he02would02be02to02show02anyone02
up!02It02must02be02noted,02by02the02way,02that02Pyotr02Petrovitch02had02
during02those02ten02days02eagerly02accepted02the02strangest02
praise02from02Andrey02Semyonovitch;02he02had02not02protested,02
for02instance,02when02Andrey02Semyonovitch02belauded02him02for02
being02ready02to02contribute02to02the02establishment02of02the02new02
"commune,"02or02to02abstain02from02christening02his02future02
children,02or02to02acquiesce02if02Dounia02were02to02take02a02lover02a02
month02after02marriage,02and02so02on.02Pyotr02Petrovitch02so02
enjoyed02hearing02his02own02praises02that02he02did02not02disdain02
even02such02virtues02when02they02were02attributed02to02him.0202
Pyotr02Petrovitch02had02had02occasion02that02morning02to02
realise02some02five\per\cent02bonds02and02now02he02sat02down02to02
the02table02and02counted02over02bundles02of02notes.02Andrey02
Semyonovitch02who02hardly02ever02had02any02money02walked02
about02the02room02pretending02to02himself02to02look02at02all02those02
bank02notes02with02indifference02and02even02contempt.02Nothing02
would02have02convinced02Pyotr02Petrovitch02that02Andrey02
Semyonovitch02could02really02look02on02the02money02unmoved,02
and02the02latter,02on02his02side,02kept02thinking02bitterly02that02Pyotr02
Petrovitch02was02capable02of02entertaining02such02an02idea02about02
him02and02was,02perhaps,02glad02of02the02opportunity02of02teasing02
his02young02friend02by02reminding02him02of02his02inferiority02and02
the02great02difference02between02them.0202
He02found02him02incredibly02inattentive02and02irritable,02
though02he,02Andrey02Semyonovitch,02began02enlarging02on02his02
favourite02 subject,02 the02 foundation02 of02 a02 new02 special02
"commune."02The02brief02remarks02that02dropped02from02Pyotr02
Petrovitch02between02the02clicking02of02the02beads02on02the02
reckoning02frame02betrayed02unmistakable02and02discourteous02
irony.02But02the02"humane"02Andrey02Semyonovitch02ascribed02
Pyotr02Petrovitch's02ill\humour02to02his02recent02breach02with02
Dounia02and02he02was02burning02with02impatience02to02discourse02
on02that02theme.02He02had02something02progressive02to02say02on02the02
subject02which02might02console02his02worthy02friend02and02"could02
not02fail"02to02promote02his02development.0202
"There02is02some02sort02of02festivity02being02prepared02at02that...02
at02the02widow's,02isn't02there?"02Pyotr02Petrovitch02asked02
suddenly,02interrupting02Andrey02Semyonovitch02at02the02most02
interesting02passage.0202
"Why,02don't02you02know?02Why,02I02was02telling02you02last02night02
what02I02think02about02all02such02ceremonies.02And02she02invited02
you02too,02I02heard.02You02were02talking02to02her02yesterday..."0202
"I02should02never02have02expected02that02beggarly02fool02would02
have02spent02on02this02feast02all02the02money02she02got02from02that02
other02fool,02Raskolnikov.02I02was02surprised02just02now02as02I02came02
through02at02the02preparations02there,02the02wines!02Several02
people02are02invited.02It's02beyond02everything!"02continued02
Pyotr02Petrovitch,02who02seemed02to02have02some02object02in02
pursuing02the02conversation.02"What?02You02say02I02am02asked02
too?02When02was02that?02I02don't02remember.02But02I02shan't02go.02
Why02should02I?02I02only02said02a02word02to02her02in02passing02
yesterday02of02the02possibility02of02her02obtaining02a02year's02salary02
as02a02destitute02widow02of02a02government02clerk.02I02suppose02she02
has02invited02me02on02that02account,02hasn't02she?02He\he\he!"0202
"I02don't02intend02to02go02either,"02said02Lebeziatnikov.0202
"I02should02think02not,02after02giving02her02a02thrashing!02You02
might02well02hesitate,02he\he!"0202
"Who02thrashed?02Whom?"02cried02Lebeziatnikov,02flustered02
and02blushing.0202
"Why,02you02thrashed02Katerina02Ivanovna02a02month02ago.02I02
heard02so02yesterday...02so02that's02what02your02convictions02
amount02to...02and02the02woman02question,02too,02wasn't02quite02
sound,02 he\he\he!"02 and02 Pyotr02 Petrovitch,02 as02 though02
comforted,02went02back02to02clicking02his02beads.0202
"It's02all02slander02and02nonsense!"02cried02Lebeziatnikov,02
who02was02always02afraid02of02allusions02to02the02subject.02"It02was02
not02like02that02at02all,02it02was02quite02different.02You've02heard02it02
wrong;02it's02a02libel.02I02was02simply02defending02myself.02She02
rushed02at02me02first02with02her02nails,02she02pulled02out02all02my02

do?02I02simply02pushed02her02back."0202
"He\he\he!"02Luzhin02went02on02laughing02maliciously.0202
"You02keep02on02like02that02because02you02are02out02of02humour02

whatever02to02do02with02the02woman02question!02You02don't02

I02am02sorry02there02won't02be02any02priests02at02it.02I02should02

"Then02you02would02sit02down02at02another02man's02table02and02

He02hastened02to02"reassure"02her02and02made02her02sit02down02

Lebeziatnikov.0202
"Is02Raskolnikov02in02there?02Has02he02come?"02he02asked02him02
in02a02whisper.0202
"Raskolnikov?02Yes.02Why?02Yes,02he02is02there.02I02saw02him02just02

"Well,02I02particularly02beg02you02to02remain02here02with02us02and02

Pyotr02Petrovitch02returned02to02the02sofa,02sat02down02
opposite02Sonia,02looked02attentively02at02her02and02assumed02an02
extremely02dignified,02even02severe02expression,02as02much02as02to02
say,02"don't02you02make02any02mistake,02madam."02Sonia02was02
overwhelmed02with02embarrassment.0202
it.02 I02 shouldn't02
"In02the02first02place,02Sofya02Semyonovna,02will02you02make02my02

Katerina02Ivanovna02stands02in02the02place02of02a02mother02to02you?"02
Pyotr02Petrovitch02began02with02great02dignity,02though02affably.0202
It02was02evident02that02his02intentions02were02friendly.0202
"Quite02so,02yes;02the02place02of02a02mother,"02Sonia02answered,02
timidly02and02hurriedly.0202
"Then02will02you02make02my02apologies02to02her?02Through02

"Yes...02I'll02tell02her...02at02once."0202

"Wait,02that's02not02all,"02Pyotr02Petrovitch02detained02her,02
smiling02at02her02simplicity02and02ignorance02of02good02manners,02
"and02you02know02me02little,02my02dear02Sofya02Semyonovna,02if02

Sonia02sat02down02hurriedly.02Her02eyes02rested02again02for02an02
instant02on02the02grey\and\rainbow\coloured02notes02that02
remained02on02the02table,02but02she02quickly02looked02away02and02
fixed02her02eyes02on02Pyotr02Petrovitch.02She02felt02it02horribly02
indecorous,02especially02for02her,02to02look02at02another02person's02
money.02She02stared02at02the02gold02eye\glass02which02Pyotr02
Petrovitch02held02in02his02left02hand02and02at02the02massive02and02
extremely02handsome02ring02with02a02yellow02stone02on02his02
middle02finger.02But02suddenly02she02looked02away02and,02not02
knowing02where02to02turn,02ended02by02staring02Pyotr02Petrovitch02
again02straight02in02the02face.02After02a02pause02of02still02greater02
dignity02he02continued.0202
"I02chanced02yesterday02in02passing02to02exchange02a02couple02of02

"Yes...02preternatural..."02Sonia02hurriedly02assented.0202

"Yes,02simpler02and02more02comprehen...02yes,02ill."0202

"Then02sit02down."02She02was02terribly02confused;02she02sat02
down02again02a02third02time.0202

distressed,02
Ivanovna,02
returned02
to02 Katerina02
overwhelmed02with02confusion.0202

Pyotr02Petrovitch02sniggered02as02he02listened,02but02without02
much02merriment.02He02hardly02heard02it02indeed.02He02was02

at02last02noticed02it.02Pyotr02Petrovitch02seemed02excited02and02
rubbed02his02hands.02Lebeziatnikov02remembered02all02this02and02
reflected02upon02it02afterwards.0202
02
0202
It02would02be02difficult02to02explain02exactly02what02could02have02

Ivanovna's02disordered02brain.02Nearly02ten02of02the02twenty02
roubles,02given02by02Raskolnikov02for02Marmeladov's02funeral,02

obliged02to02honour02the02memory02of02the02deceased02"suitably,"02
CHAPTER02II0202
that02all02the02lodgers,02and02still02more02Amalia02Ivanovna,02might02
know02"that02he02was02in02no02way02their02inferior,02and02perhaps02
very02much02their02superior,"02and02that02no02one02had02the02right02
"to02turn02up02his02nose02at02him."02Perhaps02the02chief02element02
was02that02peculiar02"poor02man's02pride,"02which02compels02many02
poor02people02to02spend02their02last02savings02on02some02traditional02
social02ceremony,02simply02in02order02to02do02"like02other02people,"02
and02not02to02"be02looked02down02upon."02It02is02very02probable,02too,02
that02Katerina02Ivanovna02longed02on02this02occasion,02at02the02
moment02when02she02seemed02to02be02abandoned02by02everyone,02
to02show02those02"wretched02contemptible02lodgers"02that02she02
knew02"how02to02do02things,02how02to02entertain"02and02that02she02
had02been02brought02up02"in02a02genteel,02she02might02almost02say02
aristocratic02colonel's02family"02and02had02not02been02meant02for02
sweeping02floors02and02washing02the02children's02rags02at02night.02
Even02the02poorest02and02most02broken\spirited02people02are02
sometimes02liable02to02these02paroxysms02of02pride02and02vanity02
which02take02the02form02of02an02irresistible02nervous02craving.02And02
Katerina02Ivanovna02was02not02broken\spirited;02she02might02
have02been02killed02by02circumstance,02but02her02spirit02could02not02
have02been02broken,02that02is,02she02could02not02have02been02
intimidated,02her02will02could02not02be02crushed.02Moreover02Sonia02
had02said02with02good02reason02that02her02mind02was02unhinged.02
She02could02not02be02said02to02be02insane,02but02for02a02year02past02she02
had02been02so02harassed02that02her02mind02might02well02be02
overstrained.02The02later02stages02of02consumption02are02apt,02
doctors02tell02us,02to02affect02the02intellect.0202
There02was02no02great02variety02of02wines,02nor02was02there02
Madeira;02but02wine02there02was.02There02was02vodka,02rum02and02
Lisbon02wine,02all02of02the02poorest02quality02but02in02sufficient02
quantity.02Besides02the02traditional02rice02and02honey,02there02
were02three02or02four02dishes,02one02of02which02consisted02of02
pancakes,02all02prepared02in02Amalia02Ivanovna's02kitchen.02Two02
samovars02were02boiling,02that02tea02and02punch02might02be02
offered02after02dinner.02Katerina02Ivanovna02had02herself02seen02to02
purchasing02the02provisions,02with02the02help02of02one02of02the02
lodgers,02an02unfortunate02little02Pole02who02had02somehow02been02
stranded02at02Madame02Lippevechsel's.02He02promptly02put02
himself02at02Katerina02Ivanovna's02disposal02and02had02been02all02
that02morning02and02all02the02day02before02running02about02as02fast02
as02his02legs02could02carry02him,02and02very02anxious02that02
everyone02should02be02aware02of02it.02For02every02trifle02he02ran02to02
Katerina02Ivanovna,02even02hunting02her02out02at02the02bazaar,02at02
every02instant02called02her02"Pani."02She02was02heartily02sick02of02
him02before02the02end,02though02she02had02declared02at02first02that02
she02could02not02have02got02on02without02this02"serviceable02and02
magnanimous02man."02It02was02one02of02Katerina02Ivanovna's02
characteristics02to02paint02everyone02she02met02in02the02most02
glowing02colours.02Her02praises02were02so02exaggerated02as02
sometimes02to02be02embarrassing;02she02would02invent02various02
circumstances02to02the02credit02of02her02new02acquaintance02and02
quite02genuinely02believe02in02their02reality.02Then02all02of02a02
sudden02she02would02be02disillusioned02and02would02rudely02and02
contemptuously02repulse02the02person02she02had02only02a02few02
hours02before02been02literally02adoring.02She02was02naturally02of02a02
gay,02
lively02 and02 peace\loving02 disposition,02 but02
from02
continual02failures02and02misfortunes02she02had02come02to02desire02
so02keenly02that02all02should02live02in02peace02and02joy02and02should02
not02 dare02to02break02the02peace,02that02the02slightest02jar,02the02
smallest02disaster02reduced02her02almost02to02frenzy,02and02she02
would02pass02in02an02instant02from02the02brightest02hopes02and02
fancies02to02cursing02her02fate02and02raving,02and02knocking02her02
head02against02the02wall.0202
Amalia02Ivanovna,02too,02suddenly02acquired02extraordinary02
importance02in02Katerina02Ivanovna's02eyes02and02was02treated02
by02her02with02extraordinary02respect,02probably02only02because02
Amalia02Ivanovna02had02thrown02herself02heart02and02soul02into02
the02preparations.02She02had02undertaken02to02lay02the02table,02to02
provide02the02linen,02crockery,02etc.,02and02to02cook02the02dishes02in02
her02kitchen,02and02Katerina02Ivanovna02had02left02it02all02in02her02
hands02and02gone02herself02to02the02cemetery.02Everything02had02
been02well02done.02Even02the02table\cloth02was02nearly02clean;02the02
crockery,02knives,02forks02and02glasses02were,02of02course,02of02all02
shapes02and02patterns,02lent02by02different02lodgers,02but02the02
table02was02properly02laid02at02the02time02fixed,02and02Amalia02
Ivanovna,02feeling02she02had02done02her02work02well,02had02put02on02a02
black02silk02dress02and02a02cap02with02new02mourning02ribbons02and02
met02the02returning02party02with02some02pride.02This02pride,02
though02justifiable,02displeased02Katerina02Ivanovna02for02some02
reason:02"as02though02the02table02could02not02have02been02laid02
except02by02Amalia02Ivanovna!"02She02disliked02the02cap02with02new02
ribbons,02too.02"Could02she02be02stuck02up,02the02stupid02German,02
because02she02was02mistress02of02the02house,02and02had02consented02
as02a02favour02to02help02her02poor02lodgers!02As02a02favour!02Fancy02
that!02Katerina02Ivanovna's02father02who02had02been02a02colonel02
and02almost02a02governor02had02sometimes02had02the02table02set02for02
forty02persons,02and02then02anyone02like02Amalia02Ivanovna,02or02
rather02Ludwigovna,02would02not02have02been02allowed02into02the02

Katerina02Ivanovna,02however,02put02off02expressing02her02
feelings02for02the02time02and02contented02herself02with02treating02
her02coldly,02though02she02decided02inwardly02that02she02would02
certainly02have02to02put02Amalia02Ivanovna02down02and02set02her02in02
her02proper02place,02for02goodness02only02knew02what02she02was02
fancying02herself.02Katerina02Ivanovna02was02irritated02too02by02
the02fact02that02hardly02any02of02the02lodgers02invited02had02come02to02
the02funeral,02except02the02Pole02who02had02just02managed02to02run02
into02the02cemetery,02while02to02the02memorial02dinner02the02

Ivanovna,02Polenka,02Sonia02and02the02Pole,02that02he02was02the02
most02generous,02noble\hearted02man02with02a02large02property02
and02vast02connections,02who02had02been02a02friend02of02her02first02
husband's,02and02a02guest02in02her02father's02house,02and02that02he02
had02promised02to02use02all02his02influence02to02secure02her02a02
considerable02pension.02It02must02be02noted02that02when02Katerina02
Ivanovna02exalted02anyone's02connections02and02fortune,02it02was02
without02any02ulterior02motive,02quite02disinterestedly,02for02the02
mere02pleasure02of02adding02to02the02consequence02of02the02person02
praised.02Probably02"taking02his02cue"02from02Luzhin,02"that02
contemptible02wretch02Lebeziatnikov02had02not02turned02up02
either.02What02did02he02fancy02himself?02He02was02only02asked02out02
of02kindness02and02because02he02was02sharing02the02same02room02
with02Pyotr02Petrovitch02and02was02a02friend02of02his,02so02that02it02
would02have02been02awkward02not02to02invite02him."0202
Among02those02who02failed02to02appear02were02"the02genteel02
lady02and02her02old\maidish02daughter,"02who02had02only02been02
lodgers02in02the02house02for02the02last02fortnight,02but02had02several02
times02complained02of02the02noise02and02uproar02in02Katerina02
Ivanovna's02room,02especially02when02Marmeladov02had02come02
back02drunk.02Katerina02Ivanovna02heard02this02from02Amalia02
Ivanovna02who,02quarrelling02with02Katerina02Ivanovna,02and02
threatening02to02turn02the02whole02family02out02of02doors,02had02
shouted02at02her02that02they02"were02not02worth02the02foot"02of02the02
honourable02lodgers02whom02they02were02disturbing.02Katerina02
Ivanovna02determined02now02to02invite02this02lady02and02her02
daughter,02"whose02foot02she02was02not02worth,"02and02who02had02
turned02away02haughtily02when02she02casually02met02them,02so02
that02they02might02know02that02"she02was02more02noble02in02her02
thoughts02and02feelings02and02did02not02harbour02malice,"02and02
might02see02that02she02was02not02accustomed02to02her02way02of02
living.02She02had02proposed02to02make02this02clear02to02them02at02
dinner02with02allusions02to02her02late02father's02governorship,02
and02also02at02the02same02time02to02hint02that02it02was02exceedingly02
stupid02of02them02to02turn02away02on02meeting02her.02The02fat02
colonel\major02(he02was02really02a02discharged02officer02of02low02
rank)02was02also02absent,02but02it02appeared02that02he02had02been02
"not02himself"02for02the02last02two02days.02The02party02consisted02of02
the02Pole,02a02wretched02looking02clerk02with02a02spotty02face02and02a02
greasy02coat,02who02had02not02a02word02to02say02for02himself,02and02
smelt02abominably,02a02deaf02and02almost02blind02old02man02who02
had02once02been02in02the02post02office02and02who02had02been02from02
immemorial02ages02maintained02by02someone02at02Amalia02
Ivanovna's.0202
A02retired02clerk02of02the02commissariat02department02came,02
too;02he02was02drunk,02had02a02loud02and02most02unseemly02laugh02
and02only02fancy―was02without02a02waistcoat!02One02of02the02
visitors02sat02straight02down02to02the02table02without02even02
greeting02Katerina02Ivanovna.02Finally02one02person02having02no02
suit02appeared02in02his02dressing\gown,02but02this02was02too02much,02
and02the02efforts02of02Amalia02Ivanovna02and02the02Pole02succeeded02
in02removing02him.02The02Pole02brought02with02him,02however,02
two02other02Poles02who02did02not02live02at02Amalia02Ivanovna's02and02
whom02no02one02had02seen02here02before.02All02this02irritated02
Katerina02Ivanovna02intensely.02"For02whom02had02they02made02all02
these02preparations02then?"02To02make02room02for02the02visitors02
the02children02had02not02even02been02laid02for02at02the02table;02but02the02
two02little02ones02were02sitting02on02a02bench02in02the02furthest02
corner02with02their02dinner02laid02on02a02box,02while02Polenka02as02a02
big02girl02had02to02look02after02them,02feed02them,02and02keep02their02
noses02wiped02like02well\bred02children's.0202
Katerina02Ivanovna,02in02fact,02could02hardly02help02meeting02
her02guests02with02increased02dignity,02and02even02haughtiness.02
She02stared02at02some02of02them02with02special02severity,02and02
loftily02invited02them02to02take02their02seats.02Rushing02to02the02
conclusion02that02Amalia02Ivanovna02must02be02responsible02for02
those02who02were02absent,02she02began02treating02her02with02
extreme02nonchalance,02which02the02latter02promptly02observed02
and02resented.02Such02a02beginning02was02no02good02omen02for02the02
end.02All02were02seated02at02last.0202
Raskolnikov02came02in02almost02at02the02moment02of02their02
return02from02the02cemetery.02Katerina02Ivanovna02was02greatly02
delighted02to02see02him,02in02the02first02place,02because02he02was02the02
one02"educated02visitor,02and,02as02everyone02knew,02was02in02two02
years02to02take02a02professorship02in02the02university,"02and02
immediately02 and02 respectfully02
secondly02 because02 he02
apologised02for02having02been02unable02to02be02at02the02funeral.02She02
positively02pounced02upon02him,02and02made02him02sit02on02her02left02
hand02(Amalia02Ivanovna02was02on02her02right).02In02spite02of02her02
continual02anxiety02that02the02dishes02should02be02passed02round02
correctly02and02that02everyone02should02taste02them,02in02spite02of02
the02agonising02cough02which02interrupted02her02every02minute02
and02seemed02to02have02grown02worse02during02the02last02few02days,02
she02hastened02to02pour02out02in02a02half02whisper02to02Raskolnikov02
all02her02suppressed02feelings02and02her02just02indignation02at02the02
failure02of02the02dinner,02interspersing02her02remarks02with02lively02
and02uncontrollable02laughter02at02the02expense02of02her02visitors02
and02especially02of02her02landlady.0202
"It's02all02that02cuckoo's02fault!02You02know02whom02I02mean?02
Her,02 her!"02 Katerina02
Ivanovna02 nodded02 towards02 the02
landlady.02"Look02at02her,02she's02making02round02eyes,02she02feels02

aloud,02"if02your02spoons02should02happen02to02be02stolen,02I02won't02
be02responsible,02I02warn02you!02Ha\ha\ha!"02She02laughed02
turning02to02Raskolnikov,02and02again02nodding02towards02the02
landlady,02in02high02glee02at02her02sally.02"She02didn't02understand,02

Here02her02laugh02turned02again02to02an02insufferable02fit02of02
coughing02that02lasted02five02minutes.02Drops02of02perspiration02
stood02out02on02her02forehead02and02her02handkerchief02was02
stained02with02blood.02She02showed02Raskolnikov02the02blood02in02
silence,02and02as02soon02as02she02could02get02her02breath02began02
whispering02to02him02again02with02extreme02animation02and02a02
hectic02flush02on02her02cheeks.0202
"Do02you02know,02I02gave02her02the02most02delicate02instructions,02

gentleman.02What02are02you02saying,02Sonia?"0202
Sonia02hastened02to02give02her02Pyotr02Petrovitch's02apologies,02
trying02to02speak02loud02enough02for02everyone02to02hear02and02
carefully02choosing02the02most02respectful02phrases02which02she02
attributed02to02Pyotr02Petrovitch.02She02added02that02Pyotr02
Petrovitch02had02particularly02told02her02to02say02that,02as02soon02as02
he02possibly02could,02he02would02come02immediately02to02discuss02
business02alone02with02her02and02to02consider02what02could02be02
done02for02her,02etc.,02etc.0202
Sonia02knew02that02this02would02comfort02Katerina02Ivanovna,02
would02flatter02her02and02gratify02her02pride.02She02sat02down02
beside02Raskolnikov;02she02made02him02a02hurried02bow,02glancing02
curiously02at02him.02But02for02the02rest02of02the02time02she02seemed02to02
avoid02looking02at02him02or02speaking02to02him.02She02seemed02
absent\minded,02though02she02kept02looking02at02Katerina02
Ivanovna,02trying02to02please02her.02Neither02she02nor02Katerina02
Ivanovna02had02been02able02to02get02mourning;02Sonia02was02
wearing02dark02brown,02and02Katerina02Ivanovna02had02on02her02
only02dress,02a02dark02striped02cotton02one.0202
The02 message02
from02 Pyotr02 Petrovitch02 was02 very02
successful.02Listening02to02Sonia02with02dignity,02Katerina02
Ivanovna02
inquired02 with02 equal02 dignity02 how02 Pyotr02
Petrovitch02was,02then02at02once02whispered02almost02aloud02to02
Raskolnikov02that02it02certainly02would02have02been02strange02for02
a02man02of02Pyotr02Petrovitch's02position02and02standing02to02find02
himself02in02such02"extraordinary02company,"02in02spite02of02his02
devotion02to02her02family02and02his02old02friendship02with02her02
father.0202
"That's02 why02
I02 am02 so02 grateful02 to02 you,02 Rodion02
Romanovitch,02that02you02have02not02disdained02my02hospitality,02
even02in02such02surroundings,"02she02added02almost02aloud.02"But02I02
am02sure02that02it02was02only02your02special02affection02for02my02poor02
husband02that02has02made02you02keep02your02promise."0202
Then02once02more02with02pride02and02dignity02she02scanned02her02
visitors,02and02suddenly02inquired02aloud02across02the02table02of02
the02deaf02man:02"Wouldn't02he02have02some02more02meat,02and02
had02he02been02given02some02wine?"02The02old02man02made02no02
answer02and02for02a02long02while02could02not02understand02what02he02
was02asked,02though02his02neighbours02amused02themselves02by02
poking02and02shaking02him.02He02simply02gazed02about02him02with02
his02mouth02open,02which02only02increased02the02general02mirth.0202
"What02an02imbecile!02Look,02look!02Why02was02he02brought?02
But02as02to02Pyotr02Petrovitch,02I02always02had02confidence02in02
him,"02Katerina02Ivanovna02continued,02"and,02of02course,02he02is02
not02like..."02with02an02extremely02stern02face02she02addressed02
Amalia02Ivanovna02so02sharply02and02loudly02that02the02latter02was02
quite02disconcerted,02"not02like02your02dressed02up02draggletails02
whom02my02father02would02not02have02taken02as02cooks02into02his02
kitchen,02and02my02late02husband02would02have02done02them02
honour02if02he02had02invited02them02in02the02goodness02of02his02
heart."0202
"Yes,02he02was02fond02of02drink,02he02was02fond02of02it,02he02did02
drink!"02cried02the02commissariat02clerk,02gulping02down02his02
twelfth02glass02of02vodka.0202
"My02late02husband02certainly02had02that02weakness,02and02
everyone02knows02it,"02Katerina02Ivanovna02attacked02him02at02
once,02"but02he02was02a02kind02and02honourable02man,02who02loved02
and02respected02his02family.02The02worst02of02it02was02his02good02
nature02made02him02trust02all02sorts02of02disreputable02people,02and02
he02drank02with02fellows02who02were02not02worth02the02sole02of02his02
shoe.02Would02you02believe02it,02Rodion02Romanovitch,02they02
found02a02gingerbread02cock02in02his02pocket;02he02was02dead02
drunk,02but02he02did02not02forget02the02children!"0202
"A02cock?02Did02you02say02a02cock?"02shouted02the02commissariat02
clerk.0202Katerina02Ivanovna02did02not02vouchsafe02a02reply.02She02
sighed,02lost02in02thought.0202
"No02doubt02you02think,02like02everyone,02that02I02was02too02
severe02with02him,"02she02went02on,02addressing02Raskolnikov.02
"But02that's02not02so!02He02respected02me,02he02respected02me02very02
much!02He02was02a02kind\hearted02man!02And02how02sorry02I02was02
for02him02sometimes!02He02would02sit02in02a02corner02and02look02at02
me,02I02used02to02feel02so02sorry02for02him,02I02used02to02want02to02be02
kind02to02him02and02then02would02think02to02myself:02'Be02kind02to02
him02and02he02will02drink02again,'02it02was02only02by02severity02that02
you02could02keep02him02within02bounds."0202
"Yes,02he02used02to02get02his02hair02pulled02pretty02often,"02roared02
the02commissariat02clerk02again,02swallowing02another02glass02of02
vodka.0202
"Some02fools02would02be02the02better02for02a02good02drubbing,02as02
well02as02having02their02hair02pulled.02I02am02not02talking02of02my02late02

The02flush02on02her02cheeks02grew02more02and02more02marked,02
her02chest02heaved.02In02another02minute02she02would02have02been02
ready02to02make02a02scene.02Many02of02the02visitors02were02
sniggering,02evidently02delighted.02They02began02poking02the02
commissariat02clerk02and02whispering02something02to02him.02
They02were02evidently02trying02to02egg02him02on.0202
"Allow02me02to02ask02what02are02you02alluding02to,"02began02the02

And02he02took02another02drink02of02vodka.0202
Raskolnikov02sat02in02silence,02listening02with02disgust.02He02
only02ate02from02politeness,02just02tasting02the02food02that02Katerina02
Ivanovna02was02continually02putting02on02his02plate,02to02avoid02
hurting02her02feelings.02He02watched02Sonia02intently.02But02Sonia02
became02more02and02more02anxious02and02distressed;02she,02too,02
foresaw02that02the02dinner02would02not02end02peaceably,02and02saw02
with02terror02Katerina02Ivanovna's02growing02irritation.02She02
knew02that02she,02Sonia,02was02the02chief02reason02for02the02'genteel'02
ladies'02contemptuous02treatment02of02Katerina02Ivanovna's02
invitation.02She02had02heard02from02Amalia02Ivanovna02that02the02
mother02was02positively02offended02at02the02invitation02and02had02
asked02the02question:02"How02could02she02let02her02daughter02sit02
down02beside02that02young02person?"02Sonia02had02a02feeling02that02
Katerina02Ivanovna02had02already02heard02this02and02an02insult02to02
Sonia02meant02more02to02Katerina02Ivanovna02than02an02insult02to02
herself,02her02children,02or02her02father,02Sonia02knew02that02
Katerina02Ivanovna02would02not02be02satisfied02now,02"till02she02had02
shown02those02draggletails02that02they02were02both..."02To02make02
matters02worse02someone02passed02Sonia,02from02the02other02end02
of02the02table,02a02plate02with02two02hearts02pierced02with02an02arrow,02
cut02out02of02black02bread.02Katerina02Ivanovna02flushed02crimson02
and02at02once02said02aloud02across02the02table02that02the02man02who02
sent02it02was02"a02drunken02ass!"0202
Amalia02Ivanovna02was02foreseeing02something02amiss,02and02
at02the02same02time02deeply02wounded02by02Katerina02Ivanovna's02
haughtiness,02and02to02restore02the02good\humour02of02the02
company02and02raise02herself02in02their02esteem02she02began,02
apropos02of02nothing,02telling02a02story02about02an02acquaintance02
of02hers02"Karl02from02the02chemist's,"02who02was02driving02one02
night02in02a02cab,02and02that02"the02cabman02wanted02him02to02kill,02
and02Karl02very02much02begged02him02not02to02kill,02and02wept02and02
clasped02hands,02and02frightened02and02from02fear02pierced02his02
heart."02Though02Katerina02Ivanovna02smiled,02she02observed02at02
once02that02Amalia02Ivanovna02ought02not02to02tell02anecdotes02in02
Russian;02the02latter02was02still02more02offended,02and02she02
retorted02that02her02"Vater02aus02Berlin02was02a02very02important02
man,02and02always02went02with02his02hands02in02pockets."02Katerina02
Ivanovna02could02not02restrain02herself02and02laughed02so02much02
that02Amalia02Ivanovna02lost02patience02and02could02scarcely02
control02herself.0202
"Listen02to02the02owl!"02Katerina02Ivanovna02whispered02at02
once,02her02good\humour02almost02restored,02"she02meant02to02say02

Regaining02her02good\humour,02Katerina02Ivanovna02began02
at02once02telling02Raskolnikov02that02when02she02had02obtained02
her02pension,02she02intended02to02open02a02school02for02the02
daughters02of02gentlemen02in02her02native02town02T――.02This02
was02the02first02time02she02had02spoken02to02him02of02the02project,02
and02she02launched02out02into02the02most02alluring02details.02It02
suddenly02appeared02that02Katerina02Ivanovna02had02in02her02
hands02the02very02certificate02of02honour02of02which02Marmeladov02
had02spoken02to02Raskolnikov02in02the02tavern,02when02he02told02him02
that02Katerina02Ivanovna,02his02wife,02had02danced02the02shawl02
dance02before02the02governor02and02other02great02personages02on02
leaving02school.02This02certificate02of02honour02was02obviously02
intended02now02to02prove02Katerina02Ivanovna's02right02to02open02a02
boarding\school;02but02she02had02armed02herself02with02it02chiefly02
with02the02object02of02overwhelming02"those02two02stuck\up02

incontestably02that02Katerina02Ivanovna02was02of02the02most02
noble,02"she02might02even02say02aristocratic02family,02a02colonel's02

of02honour02immediately02passed02into02the02hands02of02the02
drunken02guests,02and02Katerina02Ivanovna02did02not02try02to02

a02companion02of02an02order,02so02that02she02really02was02almost02the02
daughter02of02a02colonel.0202
Warming02up,02Katerina02Ivanovna02proceeded02to02enlarge02
on02the02peaceful02and02happy02life02they02would02lead02in02T――,02
on02the02gymnasium02teachers02whom02she02would02engage02to02

in02T――,02and02would02no02doubt02teach02in02her02school02on02

with02her02to02T――02and02help02her02in02all02her02plans.02At02this02
someone02at02the02further02end02of02the02table02gave02a02sudden02
guffaw.0202
Though02Katerina02Ivanovna02tried02to02appear02to02be02
disdainfully02unaware02of02it,02she02raised02her02voice02and02began02

at02once02declared,02so02that02all02could02hear,02that02Amalia02

Ivanovna02should02leave02the02lodgings02that02minute;02then02she02
rushed02for02some02reason02to02collect02the02silver02spoons02from02
the02table.02There02was02a02great02outcry02and02uproar,02the02

about02"the02yellow02ticket,"02Katerina02Ivanovna02pushed02Sonia02
away,02and02rushed02at02the02landlady02to02carry02out02her02threat.0202
At02that02minute02the02door02opened,02and02Pyotr02Petrovitch02

corner02where02Sonia02was.0202
Katerina02Ivanovna02remained02standing02where02she02was,02
as02though02thunderstruck.02She02could02not02understand02how02
Pyotr02Petrovitch02could02deny02having02enjoyed02her02father's02
hospitality.02Though02she02had02invented02it02herself,02she02
believed02in02it02firmly02by02this02time.02She02was02struck02too02by02the02
businesslike,02dry02and02even02contemptuous02menacing02tone02
of02Pyotr02Petrovitch.02All02the02clamour02gradually02died02away02at02
his02entrance.02Not02only02was02this02"serious02business02man"02
strikingly02incongruous02with02the02rest02of02the02party,02but02it02
was02evident,02too,02that02he02had02come02upon02some02matter02of02
consequence,02that02some02exceptional02cause02must02have02
brought02him02and02that02therefore02something02was02going02to02

to02let02him02pass;02Pyotr02Petrovitch02did02not02seem02to02notice02
him.02A02minute02later02Lebeziatnikov,02too,02appeared02in02the02
doorway;02he02did02not02come02in,02but02stood02still,02listening02with02
marked02interest,02almost02wonder,02and02seemed02for02a02time02

"Excuse02me02for02possibly02interrupting02you,02but02it's02a02

Complete02silence02reigned02in02the02room.02Even02the02crying02

"Well,02how02is02it02to02be02then?"02asked02Luzhin,02looking02
intently02at02her.0202
for02
"Think02

I02 proceeded02
"I02don't02know....02I02know02nothing02about02it,"02Sonia02

left02alone02with02Mr.02Lebeziatnikov02I02talked02to02him02for02ten02

"I02have02taken02nothing,"02Sonia02whispered02in02terror,02"you02
gave02me02ten02roubles,02here02it02is,02take02it."0202
Sonia02pulled02her02handkerchief02out02of02her02pocket,02untied02
a02corner02of02it,02took02out02the02ten\rouble02note02and02gave02it02to02
Luzhin.0202
"And02the02hundred02roubles02you02do02not02confess02to02

Sonia02looked02about02her.02All02were02looking02at02her02with02
such02awful,02stern,02ironical,02hostile02eyes.02She02looked02at02
Raskolnikov...02he02stood02against02the02wall,02with02his02arms02
crossed,02looking02at02her02with02glowing02eyes.0202
"Good02God!"02broke02from02Sonia.0202
"Amalia02Ivanovna,02we02shall02have02to02send02word02to02the02

"Gott02der02Barmherzige!02I02knew02she02was02the02thief,"02cried02
Amalia02Ivanovna,02throwing02up02her02hands.0202
"You02knew02it?"02Luzhin02caught02her02up,02"then02I02suppose02

There02was02a02buzz02of02loud02conversation02on02all02sides.02All02
were02in02movement.0202
"What!"02cried02Katerina02Ivanovna,02suddenly02realising02the02
position,02and02she02rushed02at02Luzhin.02"What!02You02accuse02her02
of02stealing?02Sonia?02Ah,02the02wretches,02the02wretches!"0202
And02running02to02Sonia02she02flung02her02wasted02arms02round02
her02and02held02her02as02in02a02vise.0202
"Sonia!02how02dared02you02take02ten02roubles02from02him?02
Foolish02girl!02Give02it02to02me!02Give02me02the02ten02roubles02at02

And02snatching02the02note02from02Sonia,02Katerina02Ivanovna02
crumpled02it02up02and02flung02it02straight02into02Luzhin's02face.02It02hit02
him02in02the02eye02and02fell02on02the02ground.02Amalia02Ivanovna02
hastened02to02pick02it02up.02Pyotr02Petrovitch02lost02his02temper.0202
"Hold02that02mad02woman!"02he02shouted.0202
At02 that02 moment02 several02 other02 persons,02 besides02
Lebeziatnikov,02appeared02in02the02doorway,02among02them02the02
two02ladies.0202
"What!02Mad?02Am02I02mad?02Idiot!"02shrieked02Katerina02

And02Katerina02Ivanovna02in02a02frenzy02shook02Luzhin02and02
dragged02him02towards02Sonia.0202
"I02am02ready,02I'll02be02responsible...02but02calm02yourself,02

"As02you02will!02Let02anyone02who02likes02search02her!"02cried02
Katerina02Ivanovna.02"Sonia,02turn02out02your02pockets!02See!02

And02Katerina02Ivanovna02turned―or02rather02snatched―
both02pockets02inside02out.02But02from02the02right02pocket02a02piece02
of02paper02flew02out02and02describing02a02parabola02in02the02air02fell02
at02Luzhin's02feet.02Everyone02saw02it,02several02cried02out.02Pyotr02
Petrovitch02stooped02down,02picked02up02the02paper02in02two02
fingers,02lifted02it02where02all02could02see02it02and02opened02it.02It02was02
a02hundred\rouble02note02folded02in02eight.02Pyotr02Petrovitch02
held02up02the02note02showing02it02to02everyone.0202
"Thief!02Out02of02my02lodging.02Police,02police!"02yelled02Amalia02
Ivanovna.02"They02must02to02Siberia02be02sent!02Away!"0202
Exclamations02arose02on02all02sides.02Raskolnikov02was02silent,02
keeping02his02eyes02fixed02on02Sonia,02except02for02an02occasional02
rapid02glance02at02Luzhin.02Sonia02stood02still,02as02though02
unconscious.02 She02 was02 hardly02 able02 to02 feel02 surprise.02
Suddenly02the02colour02rushed02to02her02cheeks;02she02uttered02a02
cry02and02hid02her02face02in02her02hands.0202
"No,02it02wasn't02I!02I02didn't02take02it!02I02know02nothing02about02
it,"02she02cried02with02a02heartrending02wail,02and02she02ran02to02
Katerina02Ivanovna,02who02clasped02her02tightly02in02her02arms,02as02
though02she02would02shelter02her02from02all02the02world.0202
"Sonia!02Sonia!02I02don't02believe02it!02You02see,02I02don't02believe02
it!"02she02cried02in02the02face02of02the02obvious02fact,02swaying02her02to02
and02fro02in02her02arms02like02a02baby,02kissing02her02face02
continually,02then02snatching02at02her02hands02and02kissing02them,02
too,02"you02took02it!02How02stupid02these02people02are!02Oh02dear!02
You02are02fools,02fools,"02she02cried,02addressing02the02whole02room,02
"you02don't02know,02you02don't02know02what02a02heart02she02has,02
what02a02girl02she02is!02She02take02it,02she?02She'd02sell02her02last02rag,02

The02wail02of02the02poor,02consumptive,02helpless02woman02
seemed02to02produce02a02great02effect02on02her02audience.02The02
agonised,02wasted,02consumptive02face,02the02parched02blood\
stained02lips,02the02hoarse02voice,02the02tears02unrestrained02as02a02
child's,02the02trustful,02childish02and02yet02despairing02prayer02for02

Pyotr02Petrovitch02at02any02rate02was02at02once02moved02to02
compassion.0202
"Madam,02madam,02this02incident02does02not02reflect02upon02
you!"02he02cried02impressively,02"no02one02would02take02upon02
himself02to02accuse02you02of02being02an02instigator02or02even02an02

Pyotr02Petrovitch02stole02a02glance02at02Raskolnikov.02Their02
eyes02met,02and02the02fire02in02Raskolnikov's02seemed02ready02to02
reduce02him02to02ashes.02Meanwhile02Katerina02Ivanovna02
apparently02heard02nothing.02She02was02kissing02and02hugging02
Sonia02
like02 a02 madwoman.02 The02 children,02 too,02 were02
embracing02Sonia02on02all02sides,02and02Polenka―though02she02
did02not02fully02understand02what02was02wrong―was02drowned02
in02tears02and02shaking02with02sobs,02as02she02hid02her02pretty02little02

"How02vile!"02a02loud02voice02cried02suddenly02in02the02doorway.0202
Pyotr02Petrovitch02looked02round02quickly.0202
"What02vileness!"02Lebeziatnikov02repeated,02staring02him02
straight02in02the02face.0202
Pyotr02Petrovitch02gave02a02positive02start―all02noticed02it02
and02recalled02it02afterwards.02Lebeziatnikov02strode02into02the02
room.0202
"And02you02dared02to02call02me02as02witness?"02he02said,02going02
up02to02Pyotr02Petrovitch.0202
"What02do02you02mean?02What02are02you02talking02about?"02
muttered02Luzhin.0202
"I02mean02that02you...02are02a02slanderer,02that's02what02my02
words02mean!"02Lebeziatnikov02said02hotly,02looking02sternly02at02
him02with02his02short\sighted02eyes.0202
He02was02extremely02angry.02Raskolnikov02gazed02intently02at02
him,02as02though02seizing02and02weighing02each02word.02Again02
there02was02a02silence.02Pyotr02Petrovitch02indeed02seemed02
almost02dumbfounded02for02the02first02moment.0202
"If02you02mean02that02for02me,..."02he02began,02stammering.02"But02
what's02the02matter02with02you?02Are02you02out02of02your02mind?"0202
"I'm02in02my02mind,02but02you02are02a02scoundrel!02Ah,02how02vile!02
I02have02heard02everything.02I02kept02waiting02on02purpose02to02
understand02it,02for02I02must02own02even02now02it02is02not02quite02
logical....02What02you02have02done02it02all02for02I02can't02understand."0202
"Why,02what02have02I02done02then?02Give02over02talking02in02your02
nonsensical02riddles!02Or02maybe02you02are02drunk!"0202
"You02may02be02a02drunkard,02perhaps,02vile02man,02but02I02am02
not!02I02never02touch02vodka,02for02it's02against02my02convictions.02
Would02you02believe02it,02he,02he02himself,02with02his02own02hands02
gave02Sofya02Semyonovna02that02hundred\rouble02note―I02saw02
it,02I02was02a02witness,02I'll02take02my02oath!02He02did02it,02he!"02
repeated02Lebeziatnikov,02addressing02all.0202
"Are02you02crazy,02milksop?"02squealed02Luzhin.02"She02is02
herself02before02you―she02herself02here02declared02just02now02
before02everyone02that02I02gave02her02only02ten02roubles.02How02
could02I02have02given02it02to02her?"0202
"I02saw02it,02I02saw02it,"02Lebeziatnikov02repeated,02"and02though02
it02is02against02my02principles,02I02am02ready02this02very02minute02to02
take02any02oath02you02like02before02the02court,02for02I02saw02how02you02
slipped02it02in02her02pocket.02Only02like02a02fool02I02thought02you02did02it02
out02of02kindness!02When02you02were02saying02good\bye02to02her02at02
the02door,02while02you02held02her02hand02in02one02hand,02with02the02
other,02the02left,02you02slipped02the02note02into02her02pocket.02I02saw02
it,02I02saw02it!"0202
Luzhin02turned02pale.0202
"What02lies!"02he02cried02impudently,02"why,02how02could02you,02
standing02by02the02window,02see02the02note?02You02fancied02it02with02
your02short\sighted02eyes.02You02are02raving!"0202
"No,02I02didn't02fancy02it.02And02though02I02was02standing02some02
way02off,02I02saw02it02all.02And02though02it02certainly02would02be02hard02
to02distinguish02a02note02from02the02window―that's02true―I02
knew02for02certain02that02it02was02a02hundred\rouble02note,02
because,02when02you02were02going02to02give02Sofya02Semyonovna02

up,02you02changed02it02from02your02right02hand02to02your02left02and02
nearly02dropped02it!02I02noticed02it02because02the02same02idea02
struck02me02again,02that02you02meant02to02do02her02a02kindness02
without02my02seeing.02You02can02fancy02how02I02watched02you02and02I02
saw02how02you02succeeded02in02slipping02it02into02her02pocket.02I02
saw02it,02I02saw02it,02I'll02take02my02oath."0202
Lebeziatnikov02was02almost02breathless.02Exclamations02
arose02on02all02hands02chiefly02expressive02of02wonder,02but02some02
were02menacing02in02tone.02They02all02crowded02round02Pyotr02
Petrovitch.02Katerina02Ivanovna02flew02to02Lebeziatnikov.0202
"I02was02mistaken02in02you!02Protect02her!02You02are02the02only02

Katerina02Ivanovna,02hardly02knowing02what02she02was02

my02 being02 mistaken,02 you02
infamous02 criminal02 man,02 I02
remember02how,02on02account02of02it,02a02question02occurred02to02
me02at02once,02just02when02I02was02thanking02you02and02pressing02
your02hand.02What02made02you02put02it02secretly02in02her02pocket?02
Why02you02did02it02secretly,02I02mean?02Could02it02be02simply02to02

opposed02to02yours02and02that02I02do02not02approve02of02private02
benevolence,02which02effects02no02radical02cure?02Well,02I02decided02
that02you02really02were02ashamed02of02giving02such02a02large02sum02
before02me.02Perhaps,02too,02I02thought,02he02wants02to02give02her02a02
surprise,02when02she02finds02a02whole02hundred\rouble02note02in02
her02pocket.02(For02I02know,02some02benevolent02people02are02very02
fond02of02decking02out02their02charitable02actions02in02that02way.)02
Then02the02idea02struck02me,02too,02that02you02wanted02to02test02her,02
to02see02whether,02when02she02found02it,02she02would02come02to02
thank02you.02Then,02too,02that02you02wanted02to02avoid02thanks02and02
that,02as02the02saying02is,02your02right02hand02should02not02know...02
something02of02that02sort,02in02fact.02I02thought02of02so02many02

indelicate02to02show02you02that02I02knew02your02secret.02But02
another02idea02struck02me02again02that02Sofya02Semyonovna02
might02easily02lose02the02money02before02she02noticed02it,02that02was02

finished02 his02
When02 Lebeziatnikov02
long\winded02
harangue02with02the02logical02deduction02at02the02end,02he02was02
quite02tired,02and02the02perspiration02streamed02from02his02face.02
He02could02not,02alas,02even02express02himself02correctly02in02
Russian,02though02he02knew02no02other02language,02so02that02he02was02
quite02exhausted,02almost02emaciated02after02this02heroic02
exploit.02But02his02speech02produced02a02powerful02effect.02He02had02
spoken02with02such02vehemence,02with02such02conviction02that02
everyone02obviously02believed02him.02Pyotr02Petrovitch02felt02
that02things02were02going02badly02with02him.0202
"What02is02it02to02do02with02me02if02silly02ideas02did02occur02to02you?"02
he02shouted,02"that's02no02evidence.02You02may02have02dreamt02it,02
that's02all!02And02I02tell02you,02you02are02lying,02sir.02You02are02lying02
and02slandering02from02some02spite02against02me,02simply02from02
pique,02because02I02did02not02agree02with02your02free\thinking,02
godless,02social02propositions!"0202
But02this02retort02did02not02benefit02Pyotr02Petrovitch.02
Murmurs02of02disapproval02were02heard02on02all02sides.0202
"Ah,02that's02your02line02now,02is02it!"02cried02Lebeziatnikov,02
"that's02nonsense!02Call02the02police02and02I'll02take02my02oath!02
There's02only02one02thing02I02can't02understand:02what02made02him02
risk02such02a02contemptible02action.02Oh,02pitiful,02despicable02
man!"0202
"I02can02explain02why02he02risked02such02an02action,02and02if02
necessary,02I,02too,02will02swear02to02it,"02Raskolnikov02said02at02last02
in02a02firm02voice,02and02he02stepped02forward.0202
He02appeared02to02be02firm02and02composed.02Everyone02felt02
clearly,02from02the02very02look02of02him02that02he02really02knew02
about02it02and02that02the02mystery02would02be02solved.0202
"Now02I02can02explain02it02all02to02myself,"02said02Raskolnikov,02
addressing02Lebeziatnikov.02"From02the02very02beginning02of02the02
business,02I02suspected02that02there02was02some02scoundrelly02
intrigue02at02the02bottom02of02it.02I02began02to02suspect02it02from02some02
special02circumstances02known02to02me02only,02which02I02will02
explain02at02once02to02everyone:02they02account02for02everything.02
Your02valuable02evidence02has02finally02made02everything02clear02
to02me.02I02beg02all,02all02to02listen.02This02gentleman02(he02pointed02to02

of02my02room―I02have02two02witnesses02to02prove02it.02He02is02a02very02
spiteful02man....02The02day02before02yesterday02I02did02not02know02
that02he02was02staying02here,02in02your02room,02and02that02
consequently02on02the02very02day02we02quarrelled―the02day02
before02yesterday―he02saw02me02give02Katerina02Ivanovna02
some02money02for02the02funeral,02as02a02friend02of02the02late02Mr.02
Marmeladov.02He02at02once02wrote02a02note02to02my02mother02and02
informed02her02that02I02had02given02away02all02my02money,02not02to02
Katerina02Ivanovna02but02to02Sofya02Semyonovna,02and02referred02

Semyonovna,02that02is,02hinted02at02the02character02of02my02attitude02
to02Sofya02Semyonovna.02All02this02you02understand02was02with02
the02object02of02dividing02me02from02my02mother02and02sister,02by02
insinuating02that02I02was02squandering02on02unworthy02objects02
the02money02which02they02had02sent02me02and02which02was02all02they02
had.02Yesterday02evening,02before02my02mother02and02sister02and02
in02his02presence,02I02declared02that02I02had02given02the02money02to02
Katerina02Ivanovna02for02the02funeral02and02not02to02Sofya02
Semyonovna02and02that02I02had02no02acquaintance02with02Sofya02
Semyonovna02and02had02never02seen02her02before,02indeed.02At02the02
same02time02I02added02that02he,02Pyotr02Petrovitch02Luzhin,02with02
all02his02virtues,02was02not02worth02Sofya02Semyonovna's02little02
finger,02though02he02spoke02so02ill02of02her.02To02his02question―
would02I02let02Sofya02Semyonovna02sit02down02beside02my02sister,02I02
answered02that02I02had02already02done02so02that02day.02Irritated02
that02my02mother02and02sister02were02unwilling02to02quarrel02with02
me02 at02 his02
insinuations,02 he02 gradually02 began02 being02
unpardonably02rude02to02them.02A02final02rupture02took02place02and02
he02was02turned02out02of02the02house.02All02this02happened02
yesterday02evening.02Now02I02beg02your02special02attention:02
consider:02if02he02had02now02succeeded02in02proving02that02Sofya02
Semyonovna02was02a02thief,02he02would02have02shown02to02my02
mother02and02sister02that02he02was02almost02right02in02his02
suspicions,02that02he02had02reason02to02be02angry02at02my02putting02
my02sister02on02a02level02with02Sofya02Semyonovna,02that,02in02
attacking02me,02he02was02protecting02and02preserving02the02
honour02of02my02sister,02his02betrothed.02In02fact02he02might02even,02
through02all02this,02have02been02able02to02estrange02me02from02my02
family,02and02no02doubt02he02hoped02to02be02restored02to02favour02
with02them;02to02say02nothing02of02revenging02himself02on02me02
personally,02for02he02has02grounds02for02supposing02that02the02
honour02and02happiness02of02Sofya02Semyonovna02are02very02
precious02to02me.02That02was02what02he02was02working02for!02That's02
how02I02understand02it.02That's02the02whole02reason02for02it02and02
there02can02be02no02other!"0202
It02was02like02this,02or02somewhat02like02this,02that02Raskolnikov02
wound02up02his02speech02which02was02followed02very02attentively,02
though02 often02
interrupted02 by02 exclamations02 from02 his02
audience.02But02in02spite02of02interruptions02he02spoke02clearly,02
calmly,02exactly,02firmly.02His02decisive02voice,02his02tone02of02
conviction02and02his02stern02face02made02a02great02impression02on02
everyone.0202
"Yes,02yes,02that's02it,"02Lebeziatnikov02assented02gleefully,02
"that02must02be02it,02for02he02asked02me,02as02soon02as02Sofya02
Semyonovna02came02into02our02room,02whether02you02were02here,02
whether02I02had02seen02you02among02Katerina02Ivanovna's02guests.02
He02called02me02aside02to02the02window02and02asked02me02in02secret.02
It02was02essential02for02him02that02you02should02be02here!02That's02it,02
that's02it!"0202
Luzhin02smiled02contemptuously02and02did02not02speak.02But02
he02was02very02pale.02He02seemed02to02be02deliberating02on02some02
means02of02escape.02Perhaps02he02would02have02been02glad02to02give02
up02everything02and02get02away,02but02at02the02moment02this02was02
scarcely02possible.02It02would02have02implied02admitting02the02
truth02of02the02accusations02brought02against02him.02Moreover,02
the02company,02which02had02already02been02excited02by02drink,02
was02now02too02much02stirred02to02allow02it.02The02commissariat02
clerk,02though02indeed02he02had02not02grasped02the02whole02
position,02was02shouting02louder02than02anyone02and02was02
making02some02suggestions02very02unpleasant02to02Luzhin.02But02
not02all02those02present02were02drunk;02lodgers02came02in02from02all02
the02rooms.02The02three02Poles02were02tremendously02excited02
and02were02continually02shouting02at02him:02"The02 pan02is02a02
lajdak!"02and02muttering02threats02in02Polish.02Sonia02had02been02
listening02with02strained02attention,02though02she02too02seemed02
unable02to02grasp02it02all;02she02seemed02as02though02she02had02just02
returned02to02consciousness.02She02did02not02take02her02eyes02off02
Raskolnikov,02feeling02that02all02her02safety02lay02in02him.02Katerina02
Ivanovna02 breathed02 hard02 and02 painfully02 and02 seemed02
fearfully02exhausted.02Amalia02Ivanovna02stood02looking02more02
stupid02than02anyone,02with02her02mouth02wide02open,02unable02to02
make02out02what02had02happened.02She02only02saw02that02Pyotr02
Petrovitch02had02somehow02come02to02grief.0202
Raskolnikov02was02attempting02to02speak02again,02but02they02
did02not02let02him.02Everyone02was02crowding02round02Luzhin02with02
threats02and02shouts02of02abuse.02But02Pyotr02Petrovitch02was02not02
intimidated.02Seeing02that02his02accusation02of02Sonia02had02
completely02failed,02he02had02recourse02to02insolence:0202
"Allow02me,02gentlemen,02allow02me!02Don't02squeeze,02let02me02
pass!"02he02said,02making02his02way02through02the02crowd.02"And02no02

infidels,02agitators,02and02atheists,02who02accuse02me02from02
motives02of02personal02revenge02which02they02are02foolish02

"Don't02let02me02find02a02trace02of02you02in02my02room!02Kindly02
leave02at02once,02and02everything02is02at02an02end02between02us!02
When02I02think02of02the02trouble02I've02been02taking,02the02way02I've02

"I02told02you02myself02to\day02that02I02was02going,02when02you02
tried02to02keep02me;02now02I02will02simply02add02that02you02are02a02fool.02
I02advise02you02to02see02a02doctor02for02your02brains02and02your02short02
sight.02Let02me02pass,02gentlemen!"0202
He02forced02his02way02through.02But02the02commissariat02clerk02
was02unwilling02to02let02him02off02so02easily:02he02picked02up02a02glass02
from02the02table,02brandished02it02in02the02air02and02flung02it02at02Pyotr02
Petrovitch;02but02the02glass02flew02straight02at02Amalia02Ivanovna.02
She02screamed,02and02the02clerk,02overbalancing,02fell02heavily02
under02the02table.02Pyotr02Petrovitch02made02his02way02to02his02
room02and02half02an02hour02later02had02left02the02house.02Sonia,02timid02
by02nature,02had02felt02before02that02day02that02she02could02be02ill\
treated02more02easily02than02anyone,02and02that02she02could02be02
wronged02with02impunity.02Yet02till02that02moment02she02had02
fancied02 that02 she02 might02 escape02 misfortune02 by02 care,02
gentleness02and02submissiveness02before02everyone.02Her02
disappointment02was02too02great.02She02could,02of02course,02bear02
with02patience02and02almost02without02murmur02anything,02even02
this.02But02for02the02first02minute02she02felt02it02too02bitter.02In02spite02of02
her02triumph02and02her02justification―when02her02first02terror02
and02stupefaction02had02passed02and02she02could02understand02it02
all02clearly―the02feeling02of02her02helplessness02and02of02the02
wrong02done02to02her02made02her02heart02throb02with02anguish02and02
she02was02overcome02with02hysterical02weeping.02At02last,02unable02
to02bear02any02more,02she02rushed02out02of02the02room02and02ran02
home,02almost02immediately02after02Luzhin's02departure.02When02
amidst02loud02laughter02the02glass02flew02at02Amalia02Ivanovna,02it02
was02more02than02the02landlady02could02endure.02With02a02shriek02
she02rushed02like02a02fury02at02Katerina02Ivanovna,02considering02
her02to02blame02for02everything.0202
"Out02of02my02lodgings!02At02once!02Quick02march!"0202
And02 with02 these02 words02 she02 began02 snatching02 up02
everything02she02could02lay02her02hands02on02that02belonged02to02
Katerina02Ivanovna,02and02throwing02it02on02the02floor.02Katerina02
Ivanovna,02pale,02almost02fainting,02and02gasping02for02breath,02
jumped02up02from02the02bed02where02she02had02sunk02in02exhaustion02
and02darted02at02Amalia02Ivanovna.02But02the02battle02was02too02
unequal:02the02landlady02waved02her02away02like02a02feather.0202
"What!02As02though02that02godless02calumny02was02not02
enough―this02vile02creature02attacks02me!02What!02On02the02day02
of02my02husband's02funeral02I02am02turned02out02of02my02lodging!02
After02eating02my02bread02and02salt02she02turns02me02into02the02
street,02with02my02orphans!02Where02am02I02to02go?"02wailed02the02
poor02woman,02sobbing02and02gasping.02"Good02God!"02she02cried02
with02flashing02eyes,02"is02there02no02justice02upon02earth?02Whom02
should02you02protect02if02not02us02orphans?02We02shall02see!02There02

back.02Wait02for02me,02if02you02have02to02wait02in02the02street.02We02will02
see02whether02there02is02justice02on02earth!"0202
And02throwing02over02her02head02that02green02shawl02which02
Marmeladov02had02mentioned02to02Raskolnikov,02Katerina02
Ivanovna02squeezed02her02way02through02the02disorderly02and02
drunken02crowd02of02lodgers02who02still02filled02the02room,02and,02
wailing02and02tearful,02she02ran02into02the02street―with02a02vague02
intention02of02going02at02once02somewhere02to02find02justice.02
Polenka02with02the02two02little02ones02in02her02arms02crouched,02
terrified,02on02the02trunk02in02the02corner02of02the02room,02where02she02
waited02trembling02for02her02mother02to02come02back.02Amalia02
Ivanovna02raged02about02the02room,02shrieking,02lamenting02and02
throwing02everything02she02came02across02on02the02floor.02The02
lodgers02talked02incoherently,02some02commented02to02the02best02
of02their02ability02on02what02had02happened,02others02quarrelled02
and02swore02at02one02another,02while02others02struck02up02a02song....0202
"Now02it's02time02for02me02to02go,"02thought02Raskolnikov.02
"Well,02Sofya02Semyonovna,02we02shall02see02what02you'll02say02
now!"0202And02he02set02off02in02the02direction02of02Sonia's02lodgings.0202
02
0202
Raskolnikov02had02been02a02vigorous02and02active02champion02
of02Sonia02against02Luzhin,02although02he02had02such02a02load02of02
horror02and02anguish02in02his02own02heart.02But02having02gone02
through02so02much02in02the02morning,02he02found02a02sort02of02relief02
in02a02change02of02sensations,02apart02from02the02strong02personal02
feeling02which02impelled02him02to02defend02Sonia.02He02was02
agitated02too,02especially02at02some02moments,02by02the02thought02
of02his02approaching02interview02with02Sonia:02he02had02to02tell02her02
who02had02killed02Lizaveta.02He02knew02the02terrible02suffering02it02
would02be02to02him02and,02as02it02were,02brushed02away02the02thought02
CHAPTER02IV0202
of02it.02So02when02he02cried02as02he02left02Katerina02Ivanovna's,02
"Well,02Sofya02Semyonovna,02we02shall02see02what02you'll02say02
now!"02he02was02still02superficially02excited,02still02vigorous02and02
defiant02from02his02triumph02over02Luzhin.02But,02strange02to02say,02
by02the02time02he02reached02Sonia's02lodging,02he02felt02a02sudden02
impotence02and02fear.02He02stood02still02in02hesitation02at02the02door,02
asking02himself02the02strange02question:02"Must02he02tell02her02who02
killed02Lizaveta?"02It02was02a02strange02question02because02he02felt02
at02the02very02time02not02only02that02he02could02not02help02telling02her,02
but02also02that02he02could02not02put02off02the02telling.02He02did02not02yet02
know02why02it02must02be02so,02he02only02felt02it,02and02the02agonising02
sense02of02his02impotence02before02the02inevitable02almost02
crushed02him.02To02cut02short02his02hesitation02and02suffering,02he02
quickly02opened02the02door02and02looked02at02Sonia02from02the02
doorway.02She02was02sitting02with02her02elbows02on02the02table02and02
her02face02in02her02hands,02but02seeing02Raskolnikov02she02got02up02at02
once02and02came02to02meet02him02as02though02she02were02expecting02
him.0202"What02would02have02become02of02me02but02for02you?"02she02said02
quickly,02meeting02him02in02the02middle02of02the02room.0202
Evidently02she02was02in02haste02to02say02this02to02him.02It02was02
what02she02had02been02waiting02for.0202
Raskolnikov02went02to02the02table02and02sat02down02on02the02
chair02from02which02she02had02only02just02risen.02She02stood02facing02
him,02two02steps02away,02just02as02she02had02done02the02day02before.0202
"Well,02Sonia?"02he02said,02and02felt02that02his02voice02was02
trembling,02"it02was02all02due02to02'your02social02position02and02the02
habits02associated02with02it.'02Did02you02understand02that02just02
now?"0202Her02face02showed02her02distress.0202
"Only02don't02talk02to02me02as02you02did02yesterday,"02she02
interrupted02him.02"Please02don't02begin02it.02There02is02misery02
enough02without02that."0202
She02made02haste02to02smile,02afraid02that02he02might02not02like02
the02reproach.0202
"I02was02silly02to02come02away02from02there.02What02is02
happening02there02now?02I02wanted02to02go02back02directly,02but02I02
kept02thinking02that...02you02would02come."0202
He02told02her02that02Amalia02Ivanovna02was02turning02them02out02
of02their02lodging02and02that02Katerina02Ivanovna02had02run02off02
somewhere02"to02seek02justice."0202
"My02God!"02cried02Sonia,02"let's02go02at02once...."0202
And02she02snatched02up02her02cape.0202
"It's02everlastingly02the02same02thing!"02said02Raskolnikov,02
irritably.02"You've02no02thought02except02for02them!02Stay02a02little02
with02me."0202
"But...02Katerina02Ivanovna?"0202
"You02won't02lose02Katerina02Ivanovna,02you02may02be02sure,02
she'll02come02to02you02herself02since02she02has02run02out,"02he02added02
peevishly.02"If02she02doesn't02find02you02here,02you'll02be02blamed02
for02it...."0202
Sonia02sat02down02in02painful02suspense.02Raskolnikov02was02
silent,02gazing02at02the02floor02and02deliberating.0202
"This02time02Luzhin02did02not02want02to02prosecute02you,"02he02
began,02not02looking02at02Sonia,02"but02if02he02had02wanted02to,02if02it02
had02suited02his02plans,02he02would02have02sent02you02to02prison02if02it02
had02not02been02for02Lebeziatnikov02and02me.02Ah?"0202
"Yes,"02she02assented02in02a02faint02voice.02"Yes,"02she02repeated,02
preoccupied02and02distressed.0202
"But02I02might02easily02not02have02been02there.02And02it02was02
quite02an02accident02Lebeziatnikov's02turning02up."0202
Sonia02was02silent.0202
"And02if02you'd02gone02to02prison,02what02then?02Do02you02
remember02what02I02said02yesterday?"0202
Again02she02did02not02answer.02He02waited.0202
"I02thought02you02would02cry02out02again02'don't02speak02of02it,02
leave02off.'"02Raskolnikov02gave02a02laugh,02but02rather02a02forced02
one.02"What,02silence02again?"02he02asked02a02minute02later.02"We02
must02talk02about02something,02you02know.02It02would02be02
interesting02for02me02to02know02how02you02would02decide02a02
certain02'problem'02as02Lebeziatnikov02would02say."02(He02was02
beginning02to02lose02the02thread.)02"No,02really,02I02am02serious.02
Imagine,02Sonia,02that02you02had02known02all02Luzhin's02intentions02
beforehand.02Known,02that02is,02for02a02fact,02that02they02would02be02
the02ruin02of02Katerina02Ivanovna02and02the02children02and02
yourself02thrown02in―since02you02don't02count02yourself02for02
anything―Polenka02too...02for02she'll02go02the02same02way.02Well,02if02
suddenly02it02all02depended02on02your02decision02whether02he02or02
they02should02go02on02living,02that02is02whether02Luzhin02should02go02
on02living02and02doing02wicked02things,02or02Katerina02Ivanovna02
should02die?02How02would02you02decide02which02of02them02was02to02
die?02I02ask02you?"0202
Sonia02looked02uneasily02at02him.02There02was02something02
peculiar02
in02 this02 hesitating02 question,02 which02 seemed02
approaching02something02in02a02roundabout02way.0202
"I02felt02that02you02were02going02to02ask02some02question02like02
that,"02she02said,02looking02inquisitively02at02him.0202
"I02dare02say02you02did.02But02how02is02it02to02be02answered?"0202
"Why02do02you02ask02about02what02could02not02happen?"02said02
Sonia02reluctantly.0202
"Then02it02would02be02better02for02Luzhin02to02go02on02living02and02
doing02wicked02things?02You02haven't02dared02to02decide02even02
that!"0202
"But02I02can't02know02the02Divine02Providence....02And02why02do02
you02ask02what02can't02be02answered?02What's02the02use02of02such02
foolish02questions?02How02could02it02happen02that02it02should02
depend02on02my02decision―who02has02made02me02a02judge02to02
decide02who02is02to02live02and02who02is02not02to02live?"0202
"Oh,02if02the02Divine02Providence02is02to02be02mixed02up02in02it,02
there02
is02 no02 doing02 anything,"02 Raskolnikov02 grumbled02
morosely.0202
"You'd02better02say02straight02out02what02you02want!"02Sonia02
cried02in02distress.02"You02are02leading02up02to02something02again....02
Can02you02have02come02simply02to02torture02me?"0202
She02could02not02control02herself02and02began02crying02bitterly.02
He02looked02at02her02in02gloomy02misery.02Five02minutes02passed.0202
"Of02course02you're02right,02Sonia,"02he02said02softly02at02last.02He02
was02suddenly02changed.02His02tone02of02assumed02arrogance02and02
helpless02defiance02was02gone.02Even02his02voice02was02suddenly02
weak.02"I02told02you02yesterday02that02I02was02not02coming02to02ask02
forgiveness02and02almost02the02first02thing02I've02said02is02to02ask02
forgiveness....02I02said02that02about02Luzhin02and02Providence02for02
my02own02sake.02I02was02asking02forgiveness,02Sonia...."0202
He02tried02to02smile,02but02there02was02something02helpless02and02
incomplete02in02his02pale02smile.02He02bowed02his02head02and02hid02
his02face02in02his02hands.0202
And02suddenly02a02strange,02surprising02sensation02of02a02sort02
of02bitter02hatred02for02Sonia02passed02through02his02heart.02As02it02
were02wondering02and02frightened02of02this02sensation,02he02
raised02his02head02and02looked02intently02at02her;02but02he02met02her02
uneasy02and02painfully02anxious02eyes02fixed02on02him;02there02was02
love02in02them;02his02hatred02vanished02like02a02phantom.02It02was02
not02the02real02feeling;02he02had02taken02the02one02feeling02for02the02
other.02It02only02meant02that02that02minute02had02come.0202
He02hid02his02face02in02his02hands02again02and02bowed02his02head.02
Suddenly02he02turned02pale,02got02up02from02his02chair,02looked02at02
Sonia,02and02without02uttering02a02word02sat02down02mechanically02
on02her02bed.0202
His02sensations02that02moment02were02terribly02like02the02
moment02when02he02had02stood02over02the02old02woman02with02the02
axe02in02his02hand02and02felt02that02"he02must02not02lose02another02
minute."0202
the02 matter?"02 asked02 Sonia,02 dreadfully02
"What's02
frightened.0202
He02could02not02utter02a02word.02This02was02not02at02all,02not02at02all02
the02way02he02had02intended02to02"tell"02and02he02did02not02
understand02what02was02happening02to02him02now.02She02went02up02
to02him,02softly,02sat02down02on02the02bed02beside02him02and02waited,02
not02taking02her02eyes02off02him.02Her02heart02throbbed02and02sank.02
It02was02unendurable;02he02turned02his02deadly02pale02face02to02her.02
His02lips02worked,02helplessly02struggling02to02utter02something.02
A02pang02of02terror02passed02through02Sonia's02heart.0202
"What's02the02matter?"02she02repeated,02drawing02a02little02
away02from02him.0202
"Nothing,02Sonia,02don't02be02frightened....02It's02nonsense.02It02
really02is02nonsense,02if02you02think02of02it,"02he02muttered,02like02a02
man02in02delirium.02"Why02have02I02come02to02torture02you?"02he02
added02suddenly,02looking02at02her.02"Why,02really?02I02keep02asking02
myself02that02question,02Sonia...."0202
He02had02perhaps02been02asking02himself02that02question02a02
quarter02of02an02hour02before,02but02now02he02spoke02helplessly,02
hardly02knowing02what02he02said02and02feeling02a02continual02
tremor02all02over.0202
"Oh,02how02you02are02suffering!"02she02muttered02in02distress,02
looking02intently02at02him.0202
"It's02all02nonsense....02Listen,02Sonia."02He02suddenly02smiled,02
a02pale02helpless02smile02for02two02seconds.02"You02remember02
what02I02meant02to02tell02you02yesterday?"0202
Sonia02waited02uneasily.0202
"I02said02as02I02went02away02that02perhaps02I02was02saying02good\
bye02for02ever,02but02that02if02I02came02to\day02I02would02tell02you02
who...02who02killed02Lizaveta."0202
She02began02trembling02all02over.0202
"Well,02here02I've02come02to02tell02you."0202
"Then02you02really02meant02it02yesterday?"02she02whispered02
with02difficulty.02"How02do02you02know?"02she02asked02quickly,02as02
though02suddenly02regaining02her02reason.0202
Sonia's02face02grew02paler02and02paler,02and02she02breathed02
painfully.0202
"I02know."0202
She02paused02a02minute.0202
"Have02they02found02him?"02she02asked02timidly.0202
"No."0202
"Then02how02do02you02know02about02 it?"02she02asked02again,02
hardly02audibly02and02again02after02a02minute's02pause.0202
He02turned02to02her02and02looked02very02intently02at02her.0202
"Guess,"02he02said,02with02the02same02distorted02helpless02smile.0202
A02shudder02passed02over02her.0202
"But02you...02why02do02you02frighten02me02like02this?"02she02said,02
smiling02like02a02child.0202
"I02must02be02a02great02friend02of02 his...02since02I02know,"02
Raskolnikov02went02on,02still02gazing02into02her02face,02as02though02
he02could02not02turn02his02eyes02away.02"He...02did02not02mean02to02kill02
that02Lizaveta...02he...02killed02her02accidentally....02He02meant02to02
kill02the02old02woman02when02she02was02alone02and02he02went02
there...02and02then02Lizaveta02came02in...02he02killed02her02too."0202
Another02awful02moment02passed.02Both02still02gazed02at02one02
another.0202
"You02can't02guess,02then?"02he02asked02suddenly,02feeling02as02
though02he02were02flinging02himself02down02from02a02steeple.0202
"N\no..."02whispered02Sonia.0202
"Take02a02good02look."0202
As02soon02as02he02had02said02this02again,02the02same02familiar02
sensation02froze02his02heart.02He02looked02at02her02and02all02at02once02
seemed02to02see02in02her02face02the02face02of02Lizaveta.02He02
remembered02clearly02the02expression02in02Lizaveta's02face,02
when02he02approached02her02with02the02axe02and02she02stepped02
back02to02the02wall,02putting02out02her02hand,02with02childish02terror02
in02her02face,02looking02as02little02children02do02when02they02begin02to02
be02frightened02of02something,02looking02intently02and02uneasily02
at02what02frightens02them,02shrinking02back02and02holding02out02
their02little02hands02on02the02point02of02crying.02Almost02the02same02
thing02happened02now02to02Sonia.02With02the02same02helplessness02
and02the02same02terror,02she02looked02at02him02for02a02while02and,02
suddenly02putting02out02her02left02hand,02pressed02her02fingers02
faintly02against02his02breast02and02slowly02began02to02get02up02from02
the02bed,02moving02further02from02him02and02keeping02her02eyes02
fixed02even02more02immovably02on02him.02Her02terror02infected02
him.02The02same02fear02showed02itself02on02his02face.02In02the02same02
way02he02stared02at02her02and02almost02with02the02same02 childish02
smile.0202
"Have02you02guessed?"02he02whispered02at02last.0202
"Good02God!"02broke02in02an02awful02wail02from02her02bosom.0202
She02sank02helplessly02on02the02bed02with02her02face02in02the02
pillows,02but02a02moment02later02she02got02up,02moved02quickly02to02
him,02seized02both02his02hands02and,02gripping02them02tight02in02her02
thin02fingers,02began02looking02into02his02face02again02with02the02
same02intent02stare.02In02this02last02desperate02look02she02tried02to02
look02into02him02and02catch02some02last02hope.02But02there02was02no02
hope;02there02was02no02doubt02remaining;02it02was02all02true!02Later02
on,02indeed,02when02she02recalled02that02moment,02she02thought02it02
strange02and02wondered02why02she02had02seen02at02once02that02
there02was02no02doubt.02She02could02not02have02said,02for02instance,02
that02she02had02foreseen02something02of02the02sort―and02yet02now,02
as02soon02as02he02told02her,02she02suddenly02fancied02that02she02had02
really02foreseen02this02very02thing.0202
"Stop,02Sonia,02enough!02don't02torture02me,"02he02begged02her02
miserably.0202
It02was02not02at02all,02not02at02all02like02this02he02had02thought02of02
telling02her,02but02this02is02how02it02happened.0202
She02jumped02up,02seeming02not02to02know02what02she02was02
doing,02and,02wringing02her02hands,02walked02into02the02middle02of02
the02room;02but02quickly02went02back02and02sat02down02again02
beside02him,02her02shoulder02almost02touching02his.02All02of02a02
sudden02she02started02as02though02she02had02been02stabbed,02
uttered02a02cry02and02fell02on02her02knees02before02him,02she02did02not02
know02why.0202
"What02 have02 you02 done―what02 have02 you02 done02 to02
yourself?"02she02said02in02despair,02and,02jumping02up,02she02flung02
herself02on02his02neck,02threw02her02arms02round02him,02and02held02
him02tightly.0202
Raskolnikov02drew02back02and02looked02at02her02with02a02
mournful02smile.0202
"You02are02a02strange02girl,02Sonia―you02kiss02me02and02hug02me02
when02I02tell02you02about02that....02You02don't02think02what02you02are02
doing."0202
"There02is02no02one―no02one02in02the02whole02world02now02so02
unhappy02as02you!"02she02cried02in02a02frenzy,02not02hearing02what02
he02said,02and02she02suddenly02broke02into02violent02hysterical02
weeping.0202
A02feeling02long02unfamiliar02to02him02flooded02his02heart02and02
softened02it02at02once.02He02did02not02struggle02against02it.02Two02
tears02started02into02his02eyes02and02hung02on02his02eyelashes.0202
"Then02you02won't02leave02me,02Sonia?"02he02said,02looking02at02
her02almost02with02hope.0202
"No,02no,02never,02nowhere!"02cried02Sonia.02"I02will02follow02
you,02I02will02follow02you02everywhere.02Oh,02my02God!02Oh,02how02
miserable02I02am!...02Why,02why02didn't02I02know02you02before!02Why02
didn't02you02come02before?02Oh,02dear!"0202
"Here02I02have02come."0202
"Yes,02 now!02 What's02 to02 be02 done02 now?...02 Together,02
together!"02she02repeated02as02it02were02unconsciously,02and02she02
hugged02him02again.02"I'll02follow02you02to02Siberia!"0202
He02recoiled02at02this,02and02the02same02hostile,02almost02
haughty02smile02came02to02his02lips.0202
"Perhaps02I02don't02want02to02go02to02Siberia02yet,02Sonia,"02he02
said.0202Sonia02looked02at02him02quickly.0202
Again02after02her02first02passionate,02agonising02sympathy02for02
the02unhappy02man02the02terrible02idea02of02the02murder02
overwhelmed02her.02In02his02changed02tone02she02seemed02to02hear02
the02murderer02speaking.02She02looked02at02him02bewildered.02She02
knew02nothing02as02yet,02why,02how,02with02what02object02it02had02
been.02Now02all02these02questions02rushed02at02once02into02her02
mind.02And02again02she02could02not02believe02it:02"He,02he02is02a02
murderer!02Could02it02be02true?"0202
"What's02the02meaning02of02it?02Where02am02I?"02she02said02in02
complete02bewilderment,02as02though02still02unable02to02recover02
herself.02"How02could02you,02you,02a02man02like02you....02How02could02
you02bring02yourself02to02it?...02What02does02it02mean?"0202
"Oh,02well―to02plunder.02Leave02off,02Sonia,"02he02answered02
wearily,02almost02with02vexation.0202
Sonia02stood02as02though02struck02dumb,02but02suddenly02she02
cried:0202
"You02were02hungry!02It02was...02to02help02your02mother?02Yes?"0202
"No,02Sonia,02no,"02he02muttered,02turning02away02and02hanging02
his02head.02"I02was02not02so02hungry....02I02certainly02did02want02to02
help02my02mother,02but...02that's02not02the02real02thing02either....02
Don't02torture02me,02Sonia."0202
Sonia02clasped02her02hands.0202
"Could02it,02could02it02all02be02true?02Good02God,02what02a02truth!02
Who02could02believe02it?02And02how02could02you02give02away02your02
last02farthing02and02yet02rob02and02murder!02Ah,"02she02cried02
suddenly,02"that02money02you02gave02Katerina02Ivanovna...02that02
money....02Can02that02money..."0202
"No,02Sonia,"02he02broke02in02hurriedly,02"that02money02was02not02
it.02Don't02worry02yourself!02That02money02my02mother02sent02me02
and02it02came02when02I02was02ill,02the02day02I02gave02it02to02you....02
Razumihin02saw02it...02he02received02it02for02me....02That02money02was02
mine―my02own."0202
Sonia02listened02to02him02in02bewilderment02and02did02her02
utmost02to02comprehend.0202
"And02 that02money....02I02don't02even02know02really02whether02
there02was02any02money,"02he02added02softly,02as02though02
reflecting.02"I02took02a02purse02off02her02neck,02made02of02chamois02
leather...02a02purse02stuffed02full02of02something...02but02I02didn't02
look02in02it;02I02suppose02I02hadn't02time....02And02the02things―chains02
and02trinkets―I02buried02under02a02stone02with02the02purse02next02
morning02in02a02yard02off02the02V――02Prospect.02They02are02all02
there02now...."0202
Sonia02strained02every02nerve02to02listen.0202
"Then02why...02why,02you02said02you02did02it02to02rob,02but02you02
took02nothing?"02she02asked02quickly,02catching02at02a02straw.0202
"I02don't02know....02I02haven't02yet02decided02whether02to02take02
that02money02or02not,"02he02said,02musing02again;02and,02seeming02to02
wake02up02with02a02start,02he02gave02a02brief02ironical02smile.02"Ach,02
what02silly02stuff02I02am02talking,02eh?"0202
The02thought02flashed02through02Sonia's02mind,02wasn't02he02
mad?02But02she02dismissed02it02at02once.02"No,02it02was02something02
else."02She02could02make02nothing02of02it,02nothing.0202
"Do02 you02 know,02 Sonia,"02 he02 said02 suddenly02 with02
conviction,02"let02me02tell02you:02if02I'd02simply02killed02because02I02
was02hungry,"02laying02stress02on02every02word02and02looking02
enigmatically02but02sincerely02at02her,02"I02should02be02happy02now.02
You02must02believe02that!02What02would02it02matter02to02you,"02he02
cried02a02moment02later02with02a02sort02of02despair,02"what02would02it02
matter02to02you02if02I02were02to02confess02that02I02did02wrong?02What02
do02you02gain02by02such02a02stupid02triumph02over02me?02Ah,02Sonia,02
was02it02for02that02I've02come02to02you02to\day?"0202
Again02Sonia02tried02to02say02something,02but02did02not02speak.0202
"I02asked02you02to02go02with02me02yesterday02because02you02are02
all02I02have02left."0202
"Go02where?"02asked02Sonia02timidly.0202
"Not02to02steal02and02not02to02murder,02don't02be02anxious,"02he02
smiled02bitterly.02"We02are02so02different....02And02you02know,02
Sonia,02it's02only02now,02only02this02moment02that02I02understand02
where02I02asked02you02to02go02with02me02yesterday!02Yesterday02
when02I02said02it02I02did02not02know02where.02I02asked02you02for02one02
thing,02I02came02to02you02for02one02thing―not02to02leave02me.02You02
won't02leave02me,02Sonia?"0202
She02squeezed02his02hand.0202
"And02why,02why02did02I02tell02her?02Why02did02I02let02her02know?"02
he02cried02a02minute02later02in02despair,02looking02with02infinite02
anguish02at02her.02"Here02you02expect02an02explanation02from02me,02
Sonia;02you02are02sitting02and02waiting02for02it,02I02see02that.02But02
what02can02I02tell02you?02You02won't02understand02and02will02only02
suffer02misery...02on02my02account!02Well,02you02are02crying02and02
embracing02me02again.02Why02do02you02do02it?02Because02I02couldn't02
bear02my02burden02and02have02come02to02throw02it02on02another:02
you02suffer02too,02and02I02shall02feel02better!02And02can02you02love02
such02a02mean02wretch?"0202
"But02aren't02you02suffering,02too?"02cried02Sonia.0202
Again02a02wave02of02the02same02feeling02surged02into02his02heart,02
and02again02for02an02instant02softened02it.0202
"Sonia,02I02have02a02bad02heart,02take02note02of02that.02It02may02
explain02a02great02deal.02I02have02come02because02I02am02bad.02There02
are02men02who02wouldn't02have02come.02But02I02am02a02coward02and...02
a02mean02wretch.02But...02never02mind!02That's02not02the02point.02I02
must02speak02now,02but02I02don't02know02how02to02begin."0202
He02paused02and02sank02into02thought.0202
"Ach,02we02are02so02different,"02he02cried02again,02"we02are02not02
alike.02And02why,02why02did02I02come?02I02shall02never02forgive02
myself02that."0202
"No,02no,02it02was02a02good02thing02you02came,"02cried02Sonia.02"It's02
better02I02should02know,02far02better!"0202
He02looked02at02her02with02anguish.0202
"What02if02it02were02really02that?"02he02said,02as02though02
reaching02a02conclusion.02"Yes,02that's02what02it02was!02I02wanted02to02
become02a02Napoleon,02that02is02why02I02killed02her....02Do02you02
understand02now?"0202
"N\no,"02Sonia02whispered02na07vely02and02timidly.02"Only02
speak,02speak,02I02shall02understand,02I02shall02understand02 in02
myself!"02she02kept02begging02him.0202
"You'll02understand?02Very02well,02we02shall02see!"02He02paused02
and02was02for02some02time02lost02in02meditation.0202
"It02was02like02this:02I02asked02myself02one02day02this02question―
what02if02Napoleon,02for02instance,02had02happened02to02be02in02my02

how02can02he02live02by02himself!02What02will02become02of02you02
now?"0202
"Don't02be02a02child,02Sonia,"02he02said02softly.02"What02wrong02
have02I02done02them?02Why02should02I02go02to02them?02What02should02I02
say02to02them?02That's02only02a02phantom....02They02destroy02men02
by02millions02themselves02and02look02on02it02as02a02virtue.02They02are02
knaves02and02scoundrels,02Sonia!02I02am02not02going02to02them.02And02
what02should02I02say02to02them―that02I02murdered02her,02but02did02
not02dare02to02take02the02money02and02hid02it02under02a02stone?"02he02
added02with02a02bitter02smile.02"Why,02they02would02laugh02at02me,02
and02would02call02me02a02fool02for02not02getting02it.02A02coward02and02a02
fool!02They02wouldn't02understand02and02they02don't02deserve02to02
understand.02Why02should02I02go02to02them?02I02won't.02Don't02be02a02
child,02Sonia...."0202
"It02will02be02too02much02for02you02to02bear,02too02much!"02she02
repeated,02 holding02 out02 her02 hands02
in02 despairing02
supplication.0202
"Perhaps02I've02been02unfair02to02myself,"02he02observed02
gloomily,02pondering,02"perhaps02after02all02I02am02a02man02and02not02
a02louse02and02I've02been02in02too02great02a02hurry02to02condemn02
myself.02I'll02make02another02fight02for02it."0202
A02haughty02smile02appeared02on02his02lips.0202
"What02a02burden02to02bear!02And02your02whole02life,02your02
whole02life!"0202
"I02shall02get02used02to02it,"02he02said02grimly02and02thoughtfully.02
"Listen,"02he02began02a02minute02later,02"stop02crying,02it's02time02to02
talk02of02the02facts:02I've02come02to02tell02you02that02the02police02are02
after02me,02on02my02track...."0202
"Ach!"02Sonia02cried02in02terror.0202
"Well,02why02do02you02cry02out?02You02want02me02to02go02to02
Siberia02and02now02you02are02frightened?02But02let02me02tell02you:02I02
shall02not02give02myself02up.02I02shall02make02a02struggle02for02it02and02
they02won't02do02anything02to02me.02They've02no02real02evidence.02
Yesterday02I02was02in02great02danger02and02believed02I02was02lost;02
but02to\day02things02are02going02better.02All02the02facts02they02know02
can02be02explained02two02ways,02that's02to02say02I02can02turn02their02
accusations02to02my02credit,02do02you02understand?02And02I02shall,02
for02I've02learnt02my02lesson.02But02they02will02certainly02arrest02me.02
If02it02had02not02been02for02something02that02happened,02they02would02
have02done02so02to\day02for02certain;02perhaps02even02now02they02
will02arrest02me02to\day....02But02that's02no02matter,02Sonia;02they'll02
let02me02out02again...02for02there02isn't02any02real02proof02against02me,02
and02there02won't02be,02I02give02you02my02word02for02it.02And02they02
can't02convict02a02man02on02what02they02have02against02me.02
Enough....02I02only02tell02you02that02you02may02know....02I02will02try02to02
manage02somehow02to02put02it02to02my02mother02and02sister02so02that02
they02won't02be02frightened....02My02sister's02future02is02secure,02
however,02now,02I02believe...02and02my02mother's02must02be02too....02
Well,02that's02all.02Be02careful,02though.02Will02you02come02and02see02
me02in02prison02when02I02am02there?"0202
"Oh,02I02will,02I02will."0202
They02sat02side02by02side,02both02mournful02and02dejected,02as02
though02they02had02been02cast02up02by02the02tempest02alone02on02
some02deserted02shore.02He02looked02at02Sonia02and02felt02how02
great02was02her02love02for02him,02and02strange02to02say02he02felt02it02
suddenly02burdensome02and02painful02to02be02so02loved.02Yes,02it02
was02a02strange02and02awful02sensation!02On02his02way02to02see02
Sonia02he02had02felt02that02all02his02hopes02rested02on02her;02he02
expected02to02be02rid02of02at02least02part02of02his02suffering,02and02now,02
when02all02her02heart02turned02towards02him,02he02suddenly02felt02
that02he02was02immeasurably02unhappier02than02before.0202
"Sonia,"02he02said,02"you'd02better02not02come02and02see02me02
when02I02am02in02prison."0202
Sonia02did02not02answer,02she02was02crying.02Several02minutes02
passed.0202
"Have02you02a02cross02on02you?"02she02asked,02as02though02
suddenly02thinking02of02it.0202
He02did02not02at02first02understand02the02question.0202
"No,02of02course02not.02Here,02take02this02one,02of02cypress02wood.02
I02have02another,02a02copper02one02that02belonged02to02Lizaveta.02I02
changed02with02Lizaveta:02she02gave02me02her02cross02and02I02gave02
her02my02little02ikon.02I02will02wear02Lizaveta's02now02and02give02you02
this.02Take02it...02it's02mine!02It's02mine,02you02know,"02she02begged02
him.02"We02will02go02to02suffer02together,02and02together02we02will02
bear02our02cross!"0202
"Give02it02me,"02said02Raskolnikov.0202
He02did02not02want02to02hurt02her02feelings.02But02immediately02
he02drew02back02the02hand02he02held02out02for02the02cross.0202
"Not02now,02Sonia.02Better02later,"02he02added02to02comfort02her.0202
"Yes,02yes,02better,"02she02repeated02with02conviction,02"when02
you02go02to02meet02your02suffering,02then02put02it02on.02You02will02
come02to02me,02I'll02put02it02on02you,02we02will02pray02and02go02
together."0202
At02that02moment02someone02knocked02three02times02at02the02
door.0202"Sofya02Semyonovna,02may02I02come02in?"02they02heard02in02a02
very02familiar02and02polite02voice.0202
Sonia02rushed02to02the02door02in02a02fright.02The02flaxen02head02of02
Mr.02Lebeziatnikov02appeared02at02the02door.0202

CHAPTER02V0202
LEBEZIATNIKOV02LOOKED02PERTURBED.0202
"I've02come02to02you,02Sofya02Semyonovna,"02he02began.02
"Excuse02me...02I02thought02I02should02find02you,"02he02said,02
addressing02Raskolnikov02suddenly,02"that02is,02I02didn't02mean02
anything...02of02that02sort...02But02I02just02thought...02Katerina02
Ivanovna02has02gone02out02of02her02mind,"02he02blurted02out02
suddenly,02turning02from02Raskolnikov02to02Sonia.0202
Sonia02screamed.0202
"At02least02it02seems02so.02But...02we02don't02know02what02to02do,02
you02see!02She02came02back―she02seems02to02have02been02turned02
out02somewhere,02perhaps02beaten....02So02it02seems02at02least,...02
She02had02run02to02your02father's02former02chief,02she02didn't02find02
him02at02home:02he02was02dining02at02some02other02general's....02Only02
fancy,02she02rushed02off02there,02to02the02other02general's,02and,02
imagine,02she02was02so02persistent02that02she02managed02to02get02the02
chief02to02see02her,02had02him02fetched02out02from02dinner,02it02seems.02
You02can02imagine02what02happened.02She02was02turned02out,02of02
course;02but,02according02to02her02own02story,02she02abused02him02
and02threw02something02at02him.02One02may02well02believe02it....02
How02it02is02she02wasn't02taken02up,02I02can't02understand!02Now02she02
is02telling02everyone,02including02Amalia02Ivanovna;02but02it's02
difficult02to02understand02her,02she02is02screaming02and02flinging02
herself02about....02Oh02yes,02she02shouts02that02since02everyone02has02
abandoned02her,02she02will02take02the02children02and02go02into02the02
street02with02a02barrel\organ,02and02the02children02will02sing02and02
dance,02and02she02too,02and02collect02money,02and02will02go02every02
day02under02the02general's02window...02'to02let02everyone02see02
well\born02children,02whose02father02was02an02official,02begging02
in02the02street.'02She02keeps02beating02the02children02and02they02are02
all02crying.02She02is02teaching02Lida02to02sing02'My02Village,'02the02boy02
to02dance,02Polenka02the02same.02She02is02tearing02up02all02the02

to02carry02a02tin02basin02and02make02it02tinkle,02instead02of02music....02
She02won't02listen02to02anything....02Imagine02the02state02of02things!02
It's02beyond02anything!"0202
Lebeziatnikov02would02have02gone02on,02but02Sonia,02who02had02
heard02him02almost02breathless,02snatched02up02her02cloak02and02
hat,02and02ran02out02of02the02room,02putting02on02her02things02as02she02
went.02Raskolnikov02followed02her02and02Lebeziatnikov02came02
after02him.0202
"She02has02certainly02gone02mad!"02he02said02to02Raskolnikov,02
as02they02went02out02into02the02street.02"I02didn't02want02to02frighten02
Sofya02Semyonovna,02so02I02said02'it02seemed02like02it,'02but02there02
isn't02a02doubt02of02it.02They02say02that02in02consumption02the02
tubercles02sometimes02occur02in02the02brain;02it's02a02pity02I02know02
nothing02of02medicine.02I02did02try02to02persuade02her,02but02she02
wouldn't02listen."0202
"Did02you02talk02to02her02about02the02tubercles?"0202
"Not02precisely02of02the02tubercles.02Besides,02she02wouldn't02
have02understood!02But02what02I02say02is,02that02if02you02convince02a02
person02logically02that02he02has02nothing02to02cry02about,02he'll02stop02
crying.02That's02clear.02Is02it02your02conviction02that02he02won't?"0202
"Life02would02be02too02easy02if02it02were02so,"02answered02
Raskolnikov.0202
"Excuse02me,02excuse02me;02of02course02it02would02be02rather02
difficult02for02Katerina02Ivanovna02to02understand,02but02do02you02
know02that02in02Paris02they02have02been02conducting02serious02
experiments02as02to02the02possibility02of02curing02the02insane,02
simply02by02logical02argument?02One02professor02there,02a02
scientific02man02of02standing,02lately02dead,02believed02in02the02
possibility02of02such02treatment.02His02idea02was02that02there's02
nothing02really02wrong02with02the02physical02organism02of02the02
insane,02and02that02insanity02is,02so02to02say,02a02logical02mistake,02an02
error02of02judgment,02an02incorrect02view02of02things.02He02
gradually02showed02the02madman02his02error02and,02would02you02
believe02it,02they02say02he02was02successful?02But02as02he02made02use02
of02douches02too,02how02far02success02was02due02to02that02treatment02
remains02uncertain....02So02it02seems02at02least."0202
Raskolnikov02had02long02ceased02to02listen.02Reaching02the02
house02where02he02lived,02he02nodded02to02Lebeziatnikov02and02
went02in02at02the02gate.02Lebeziatnikov02woke02up02with02a02start,02
looked02about02him02and02hurried02on.0202
Raskolnikov02went02into02his02little02room02and02stood02still02in02
the02middle02of02it.02Why02had02he02come02back02here?02He02looked02at02
the02yellow02and02tattered02paper,02at02the02dust,02at02his02sofa....02
From02the02yard02came02a02loud02continuous02knocking;02someone02
seemed02to02be02hammering...02He02went02to02the02window,02rose02
on02tiptoe02and02looked02out02into02the02yard02for02a02long02time02with02
an02air02of02absorbed02attention.02But02the02yard02was02empty02and02
he02could02not02see02who02was02hammering.02In02the02house02on02the02
left02he02saw02some02open02windows;02on02the02window\sills02were02
pots02of02sickly\looking02geraniums.02Linen02was02hung02out02of02
the02windows...02He02knew02it02all02by02heart.02He02turned02away02and02
sat02down02on02the02sofa.0202
Never,02never02had02he02felt02himself02so02fearfully02alone!0202
Yes,02he02felt02once02more02that02he02would02perhaps02come02to02
hate02Sonia,02now02that02he02had02made02her02more02miserable.0202
"Why02had02he02gone02to02her02to02beg02for02her02tears?02What02
need02had02he02to02poison02her02life?02Oh,02the02meanness02of02it!"0202
"I02will02remain02alone,"02he02said02resolutely,02"and02she02shall02
not02come02to02the02prison!"0202
Five02minutes02later02he02raised02his02head02with02a02strange02
smile.02That02was02a02strange02thought.0202
"Perhaps02it02really02would02be02better02in02Siberia,"02he02
thought02suddenly.0202
He02could02not02have02said02how02long02he02sat02there02with02
vague02thoughts02surging02through02his02mind.02All02at02once02the02
door02opened02and02Dounia02came02in.02At02first02she02stood02still02
and02looked02at02him02from02the02doorway,02just02as02he02had02done02
at02Sonia;02then02she02came02in02and02sat02down02in02the02same02place02
as02yesterday,02on02the02chair02facing02him.02He02looked02silently02
and02almost02vacantly02at02her.0202
"Don't02be02angry,02brother;02I've02only02come02for02one02
minute,"02said02Dounia.0202
Her02face02looked02thoughtful02but02not02stern.02Her02eyes02were02
bright02and02soft.02He02saw02that02she02too02had02come02to02him02with02
love.0202"Brother,02now02I02know02all,02 all.02Dmitri02Prokofitch02has02
explained02and02told02me02everything.02They02are02worrying02and02
persecuting02you02through02a02stupid02and02contemptible02
suspicion....02Dmitri02Prokofitch02told02me02that02there02is02no02
danger,02and02that02you02are02wrong02in02looking02upon02it02with02
such02horror.02I02don't02think02so,02and02I02fully02understand02how02
indignant02you02must02be,02and02that02that02indignation02may02have02
a02permanent02effect02on02you.02That's02what02I02am02afraid02of.02As02
for02your02cutting02yourself02off02from02us,02I02don't02judge02you,02I02
don't02venture02to02judge02you,02and02forgive02me02for02having02
blamed02you02for02it.02I02feel02that02I02too,02if02I02had02so02great02a02
trouble,02should02keep02away02from02everyone.02I02shall02tell02
mother02nothing02 of02 this,02but02I02shall02talk02about02you02
continually02and02shall02tell02her02from02you02that02you02will02come02
very02soon.02Don't02worry02about02her;02 I02will02set02her02mind02at02
rest;02but02don't02you02try02her02too02much―come02once02at02least;02
remember02that02she02is02your02mother.02And02now02I02have02come02
simply02to02say"02(Dounia02began02to02get02up)02"that02if02you02should02
need02me02or02should02need...02all02my02life02or02anything...02call02me,02
and02I'll02come.02Good\bye!"0202
She02turned02abruptly02and02went02towards02the02door.0202
"Dounia!"02Raskolnikov02stopped02her02and02went02towards02
her.02"That02Razumihin,02Dmitri02Prokofitch,02is02a02very02good02
fellow."0202
Dounia02flushed02slightly.0202
"Well?"02she02asked,02waiting02a02moment.0202
"He02is02competent,02hardworking,02honest02and02capable02of02
real02love....02Good\bye,02Dounia."0202
Dounia02flushed02crimson,02then02suddenly02she02took02alarm.0202
"But02what02does02it02mean,02brother?02Are02we02really02parting02
for02ever02that02you...02give02me02such02a02parting02message?"0202
"Never02mind....02Good\bye."0202
He02turned02away,02and02walked02to02the02window.02She02stood02
a02moment,02looked02at02him02uneasily,02and02went02out02troubled.0202

very02last02one)02when02he02had02longed02to02take02her02in02his02arms02
and02 say02good02bye02to02her,02and02even02to 02tell02her,02but02he02had02
not02dared02even02to02touch02her02hand.0202
"Afterwards02she02may02shudder02when02she02remembers02
that02I02embraced02her,02and02will02feel02that02I02stole02her02kiss."0202
"And02would02 she02stand02that02test?"02he02went02on02a02few02
minutes02later02to02himself.02"No,02she02wouldn't;02girls02like02that02
can't02stand02things!02They02never02do."0202
And02he02thought02of02Sonia.0202
There02was02a02breath02of02fresh02air02from02the02window.02The02
daylight02was02fading.02He02took02up02his02cap02and02went02out.0202
He02could02not,02of02course,02and02would02not02consider02how02ill02
he02was.02But02all02this02continual02anxiety02and02agony02of02mind02
could02not02but02affect02him.02And02if02he02were02not02lying02in02high02
fever02it02was02perhaps02just02because02this02continual02inner02
strain02helped02to02keep02him02on02his02legs02and02in02possession02of02
his02faculties.02But02this02artificial02excitement02could02not02last02
long.0202He02wandered02aimlessly.02The02sun02was02setting.02A02special02
form02of02misery02had02begun02to02oppress02him02of02late.02There02
was02nothing02poignant,02nothing02acute02about02it;02but02there02
was02a02feeling02of02permanence,02of02eternity02about02it;02it02
brought02a02foretaste02of02hopeless02years02of02this02cold02leaden02
misery,02a02foretaste02of02an02eternity02"on02a02square02yard02of02

weigh02on02him02more02heavily.0202
"With02this02idiotic,02purely02physical02weakness,02depending02

he02muttered02bitterly.0202
He02 heard02 his02 name02 called.02 He02
looked02 round.02
Lebeziatnikov02rushed02up02to02him.0202
"Only02fancy,02I've02been02to02your02room02looking02for02you.02

"And02Sonia?"02Raskolnikov02asked02anxiously,02hurrying02
after02Lebeziatnikov.0202
"Simply02frantic.02That02is,02it's02not02Sofya02Semyonovna's02

On02the02canal02bank02near02the02bridge02and02not02two02houses02
away02from02the02one02where02Sonia02lodged,02there02was02a02crowd02
of02people,02consisting02principally02of02gutter02children.02The02
hoarse02broken02voice02of02Katerina02Ivanovna02could02be02heard02
from02the02bridge,02and02it02certainly02was02a02strange02spectacle02

She02 was02 exhausted02 and02 breathless.02 Her02 wasted02

indeed02out02of02doors02in02the02sunshine02a02consumptive02always02
looks02worse02than02at02home.02But02her02excitement02did02not02flag,02
and02every02moment02her02irritation02grew02more02intense.02She02
rushed02at02the02children,02shouted02at02them,02coaxed02them,02told02
them02before02the02crowd02how02to02dance02and02what02to02sing,02
began02explaining02to02them02why02it02was02necessary,02and02
driven02to02desperation02by02their02not02understanding,02beat02
them....02Then02she02would02make02a02rush02at02the02crowd;02if02she02
noticed02any02decently02dressed02person02stopping02to02look,02she02
immediately02appealed02to02him02to02see02what02these02children02
"from02a02genteel,02one02may02say02aristocratic,02house"02had02been02

she02would02rush02at02once02at02the02scoffers02and02begin02
squabbling02with02them.02Some02people02laughed,02others02shook02
their02heads,02but02everyone02felt02curious02at02the02sight02of02the02

of02which02Lebeziatnikov02had02spoken02was02not02there,02at02least02

when02she02made02Lida02and02Kolya02dance02and02Polenka02sing.02

was02the02weeping02and02terror02of02Kolya02and02Lida.02Some02effort02
had02been02made02to02dress02the02children02up02as02street02singers02

mother,02and02kept02at02her02side,02hiding02her02tears.02She02dimly02
realised02her02mother's02condition,02and02looked02uneasily02about02
her.02She02was02terribly02frightened02of02the02street02and02the02
crowd.02Sonia02followed02Katerina02Ivanovna,02weeping02and02
beseeching02her02to02return02home,02but02Katerina02Ivanovna02was02
not02to02be02persuaded.0202
"Leave02off,02Sonia,02leave02off,"02she02shouted,02speaking02fast,02

going?"02she02cried02suddenly02in02alarm.02"Oh,02silly02children!02
Kolya,02Lida,02where02are02they02off02to?..."0202
Kolya02and02Lida,02scared02out02of02their02wits02by02the02crowd,02
and02their02mother's02mad02pranks,02suddenly02seized02each02
other02by02the02hand,02and02ran02off02at02the02sight02of02the02policeman02
who02wanted02to02take02them02away02somewhere.02Weeping02and02
wailing,02poor02Katerina02Ivanovna02ran02after02them.02She02was02a02
piteous02and02unseemly02spectacle,02as02she02ran,02weeping02and02
panting02for02breath.02Sonia02and02Polenka02rushed02after02them.0202
"Bring02them02back,02bring02them02back,02Sonia!02Oh02stupid,02
ungrateful02children!...02Polenka!02catch02them....02It's02for02your02
sakes02I..."0202
She02stumbled02as02she02ran02and02fell02down.0202
"She's02cut02herself,02she's02bleeding!02Oh,02dear!"02cried02Sonia,02
bending02over02her.0202
All02ran02up02and02crowded02around.02Raskolnikov02and02
Lebeziatnikov02were02the02first02at02her02side,02the02official02too02
hastened02 up,02 and02 behind02 him02 the02 policeman02 who02
muttered,02"Bother!"02with02a02gesture02of02impatience,02feeling02
that02the02job02was02going02to02be02a02troublesome02one.0202
"Pass02on!02Pass02on!"02he02said02to02the02crowd02that02pressed02
forward.0202
"She's02dying,"02someone02shouted.0202
"She's02gone02out02of02her02mind,"02said02another.0202
"Lord02have02mercy02upon02us,"02said02a02woman,02crossing02
herself.02"Have02they02caught02the02little02girl02and02the02boy?02
They're02being02brought02back,02the02elder02one's02got02them....02Ah,02
the02naughty02imps!"0202
When02they02examined02Katerina02Ivanovna02carefully,02they02
saw02that02she02had02not02cut02herself02against02a02stone,02as02Sonia02
thought,02but02that02the02blood02that02stained02the02pavement02red02
was02from02her02chest.0202
"I've02 seen02 that02 before,"02 muttered02 the02 official02 to02
Raskolnikov02and02Lebeziatnikov;02"that's02consumption;02the02
blood02flows02and02chokes02the02patient.02I02saw02the02same02thing02
to02 be02
with02a02relative02of02my02own02not02long02ago...02nearly02a02pint02of02
blood,02all02in02a02minute....02What's02to02be02done02though?02She02is02
dying."0202
"This02way,02this02way,02to02my02room!"02Sonia02implored.02"I02
live02here!...02See,02that02house,02the02second02from02here....02Come02
to02me,02make02haste,"02she02turned02from02one02to02the02other.02
"Send02for02the02doctor!02Oh,02dear!"0202
Thanks02to02the02official's02efforts,02this02plan02was02adopted,02
the02policeman02even02helping02to02carry02Katerina02Ivanovna.02
She02was02carried02to02Sonia's02room,02almost02unconscious,02and02
laid02on02the02bed.02The02blood02was02still02flowing,02but02she02
coming02
seemed02
to02 herself.02 Raskolnikov,02
Lebeziatnikov,02and02the02official02accompanied02Sonia02into02the02
room02and02were02followed02by02the02policeman,02who02first02drove02
back02the02crowd02which02followed02to02the02very02door.02Polenka02
came02in02holding02Kolya02and02Lida,02who02were02trembling02and02
the02
from02
weeping.02 Several02 persons02 came02
Kapernaumovs'02room;02the02landlord,02a02lame02one\eyed02man02
of02strange02appearance02with02whiskers02and02hair02that02stood02
up02like02a02brush,02his02wife,02a02woman02with02an02everlastingly02
scared02expression,02and02several02open\mouthed02children02
with02wonder\struck02faces.02Among02these,02Svidriga07lov02
suddenly02made02his02appearance.02Raskolnikov02looked02at02him02
with02surprise,02not02understanding02where02he02had02come02from02
and02not02having02noticed02him02in02the02crowd.02A02doctor02and02
priest02 wore02 spoken02 of.02 The02 official02 whispered02
to02
Raskolnikov02that02he02thought02it02was02too02late02now02for02the02
doctor,02but02he02ordered02him02to02be02sent02for.02Kapernaumov02
ran02himself.0202
Meanwhile02Katerina02Ivanovna02had02regained02her02breath.02
The02bleeding02ceased02for02a02time.02She02looked02with02sick02but02
intent02and02penetrating02eyes02at02Sonia,02who02stood02pale02and02
trembling,02wiping02the02sweat02from02her02brow02with02a02
too02
in02
handkerchief.02At02last02she02asked02to02be02raised.02They02sat02her02
up02on02the02bed,02supporting02her02on02both02sides.0202
"Where02are02the02children?"02she02said02in02a02faint02voice.02
"You've02brought02them,02Polenka?02Oh02the02sillies!02Why02did02
you02run02away....02Och!"0202
Once02more02her02parched02lips02were02covered02with02blood.02
She02moved02her02eyes,02looking02about02her.0202
"So02that's02how02you02live,02Sonia!02Never02once02have02I02been02
in02your02room."0202
She02looked02at02her02with02a02face02of02suffering.0202
"We02have02been02your02ruin,02Sonia.02Polenka,02Lida,02Kolya,02
come02here!02Well,02here02they02are,02Sonia,02take02them02all!02I02hand02
them02over02to02you,02I've02had02enough!02The02ball02is02over."02
(Cough!)02"Lay02me02down,02let02me02die02in02peace."0202
They02laid02her02back02on02the02pillow.0202
"What,02the02priest?02I02don't02want02him.02You02haven't02got02a02
rouble02to02spare.02I02have02no02sins.02God02must02forgive02me02
without02that.02He02knows02how02I02have02suffered....02And02if02He02
won't02forgive02me,02I02don't02care!"0202
She02sank02more02and02more02into02uneasy02delirium.02At02times02
she02shuddered,02turned02her02eyes02from02side02to02side,02
recognised02everyone02for02a02minute,02but02at02once02sank02into02
delirium02again.02Her02breathing02was02hoarse02and02difficult,02
there02was02a02sort02of02rattle02in02her02throat.0202
"I02said02to02him,02your02excellency,"02she02ejaculated,02gasping02
after02each02word.02"That02Amalia02Ludwigovna,02ah!02Lida,02

"What02an02idea!02Was02willst02du02mehr?02What02things02the02fool02

"In02the02heat02of02midday02in02the02vale02of02Dagestan.0202
"Ah,02how02I02loved02it!02I02loved02that02song02to02distraction,02

to02sing!02How02does02it02go?02I've02forgotten.02Remind02me!02How02

She02was02violently02excited02and02tried02to02sit02up.02At02last,02in02a02
horribly02hoarse,02broken02voice,02she02began,02shrieking02and02
gasping02at02every02word,02with02a02look02of02growing02terror.0202
"In02the02heat02of02midday!...02in02the02vale!...02of02Dagestan!...02
With02lead02in02my02breast!..."0202
"Your02excellency!"02she02wailed02suddenly02with02a02heart\
rending02scream02and02a02flood02of02tears,02"protect02the02orphans!02
You02have02 been02their02father's02 guest...02one02 may02say02
aristocratic...."02She02started,02regaining02consciousness,02and02
gazed02at02all02with02a02sort02of02terror,02but02at02once02recognised02
Sonia.0202
"Sonia,02Sonia!"02she02articulated02softly02and02caressingly,02as02
though02surprised02to02find02her02there.02"Sonia02darling,02are02you02
here,02too?"0202
They02lifted02her02up02again.0202
"Enough!02It's02over!02Farewell,02poor02thing!02I02am02done02for!02
I02am02broken!"02she02cried02with02vindictive02despair,02and02her02
head02fell02heavily02back02on02the02pillow.0202
She02sank02into02unconsciousness02again,02but02this02time02it02
did02not02last02long.02Her02pale,02yellow,02wasted02face02dropped02
back,02her02mouth02fell02open,02her02leg02moved02convulsively,02she02
gave02a02deep,02deep02sigh02and02died.0202
Sonia02fell02upon02her,02flung02her02arms02about02her,02and02
remained02motionless02with02her02head02pressed02to02the02dead02
woman's02wasted02bosom.02Polenka02threw02herself02at02her02
mother's02feet,02kissing02them02and02weeping02violently.02Though02
Kolya02and02Lida02did02not02understand02what02had02happened,02
they02had02a02feeling02that02it02was02something02terrible;02they02put02
their02hands02on02each02other's02little02shoulders,02stared02straight02
at02one02another02and02both02at02once02opened02their02mouths02and02
began02screaming.02They02were02both02still02in02their02fancy02dress;02
one02in02a02turban,02the02other02in02the02cap02with02the02ostrich02
feather.0202
And02how02did02"the02certificate02of02merit"02come02to02be02on02the02
bed02beside02Katerina02Ivanovna?02It02lay02there02by02the02pillow;02
Raskolnikov02saw02it.0202
He02walked02away02to02the02window.02Lebeziatnikov02skipped02
up02to02him.0202
"She02is02dead,"02he02said.0202
"Rodion02Romanovitch,02I02must02have02two02words02with02
you,"02said02Svidriga07lov,02coming02up02to02them.0202
Lebeziatnikov02 at02 once02 made02 room02 for02 him02 and02
delicately02 withdrew.02 Svidriga07lov02 drew02 Raskolnikov02
further02away.0202
"I02will02undertake02all02the02arrangements,02the02funeral02and02
that.02You02know02it's02a02question02of02money02and,02as02I02told02you,02I02

good02girl,02isn't02she?02So02tell02Avdotya02Romanovna02that02that02is02
how02I02am02spending02her02ten02thousand."0202
"What02is02your02motive02for02such02benevolence?"02asked02
Raskolnikov.0202
"Ah!02you02sceptical02person!"02laughed02Svidriga07lov.02"I02told02
you02I02had02no02need02of02that02money.02Won't02you02admit02that02it's02
simply02done02from02humanity?02She02wasn't02'a02louse,'02you02

lay),02"was02she,02like02some02old02pawnbroker02woman?02Come,02
you'll02agree,02is02Luzhin02to02go02on02living,02and02doing02wicked02
things02or02is02she02to02die?02And02if02I02didn't02help02them,02Polenka02
would02go02the02same02way."0202
He02said02this02with02an02air02of02a02sort02of02gay02winking02slyness,02
keeping02his02eyes02fixed02on02Raskolnikov,02who02turned02white02
and02cold,02hearing02his02own02phrases,02spoken02to02Sonia.02He02
quickly02stepped02back02and02looked02wildly02at02Svidriga07lov.0202
"How02do02you02know?"02he02whispered,02hardly02able02to02
breathe.0202
"Why,02I02lodge02here02at02Madame02Resslich's,02the02other02side02
of02the02wall.02Here02is02Kapernaumov,02and02there02lives02Madame02

"You?"0202
"Yes,"02continued02Svidriga07lov,02shaking02with02laughter.02"I02

CHAPTER02I0202
02
0202
A02strange02period02began02for02Raskolnikov:02it02was02as02
though02a02fog02had02fallen02upon02him02and02wrapped02him02in02a02
dreary02solitude02from02which02there02was02no02escape.02Recalling02
that02period02long02after,02he02believed02that02his02mind02had02been02
clouded02at02times,02and02that02it02had02continued02so,02with02
intervals,02till02the02final02catastrophe.02He02was02convinced02that02
he02had02been02mistaken02about02many02things02at02that02time,02for02
instance02as02to02the02date02of02certain02events.02Anyway,02when02he02
tried02later02on02to02piece02his02recollections02together,02he02learnt02
a02great02deal02about02himself02from02what02other02people02told02
him.02He02had02mixed02up02incidents02and02had02explained02events02
as02due02to02circumstances02which02existed02only02in02his02
imagination.02At02times02he02was02a02prey02to02agonies02of02morbid02
uneasiness,02 amounting02 sometimes02 to02 panic.02 But02 he02
remembered,02too,02moments,02hours,02perhaps02whole02days,02of02
complete02apathy,02which02came02upon02him02as02a02reaction02from02
his02previous02terror02and02might02be02compared02with02the02
abnormal02insensibility,02sometimes02seen02in02the02dying.02He02
seemed02to02be02trying02in02that02latter02stage02to02escape02from02a02
full02and02clear02understanding02of02his02position.02Certain02
essential02facts02which02required02immediate02consideration02
were02particularly02irksome02to02him.02How02glad02he02would02have02
been02to02be02free02from02some02cares,02the02neglect02of02which02
would02have02threatened02him02with02complete,02inevitable02ruin.0202
He02was02particularly02worried02about02Svidriga07lov,02he02
might02be02said02to02be02permanently02thinking02of02Svidriga07lov.02
From02 the02 time02 of02 Svidriga07lov's02 too02 menacing02 and02
unmistakable02words02in02Sonia's02room02at02the02moment02of02
Katerina02Ivanovna's02death,02the02normal02working02of02his02
mind02seemed02to02break02down.02But02although02this02new02fact02
caused02him02extreme02uneasiness,02Raskolnikov02was02in02no02
hurry02for02an02explanation02of02it.02At02times,02finding02himself02in02a02
solitary02and02remote02part02of02the02town,02in02some02wretched02
eating\house,02sitting02alone02lost02in02thought,02hardly02knowing02
how02 he02 had02 come02 there,02 he02 suddenly02 thought02 of02
Svidriga07lov.02He02recognised02suddenly,02clearly,02and02with02
dismay02that02he02ought02at02once02to02come02to02an02understanding02
with02that02man02and02to02make02what02terms02he02could.02Walking02
outside02the02city02gates02one02day,02he02positively02fancied02that02
they02had02fixed02a02meeting02there,02that02he02was02waiting02for02
Svidriga07lov.02Another02time02he02woke02up02before02daybreak02
lying02on02the02ground02under02some02bushes02and02could02not02at02
first02understand02how02he02had02come02there.0202
But02during02the02two02or02three02days02after02Katerina02
Ivanovna's02 death,02 he02 had02 two02 or02 three02 times02 met02
Svidriga07lov02at02Sonia's02lodging,02where02he02had02gone02
aimlessly02for02a02moment.02They02exchanged02a02few02words02and02
made02no02reference02to02the02vital02subject,02as02though02they02
were02tacitly02agreed02not02to02speak02of02it02for02a02time.0202
Katerina02Ivanovna's02body02was02still02lying02in02the02coffin,02
Svidriga07lov02was02busy02making02arrangements02for02the02
funeral.02Sonia02too02was02very02busy.02At02their02last02meeting02
Svidriga07lov02informed02Raskolnikov02that02he02had02made02an02
arrangement,02and02a02very02satisfactory02one,02for02Katerina02
Ivanovna's02 children;02
through02 certain02
that02 he02 had,02
connections,02 succeeded02
in02 getting02 hold02 of02 certain02
personages02by02whose02help02the02three02orphans02could02be02at02
once02placed02in02very02suitable02institutions;02that02the02money02
he02had02settled02on02them02had02been02of02great02assistance,02as02it02is02
much02easier02to02place02orphans02with02some02property02than02
destitute02ones.02He02said02something02too02about02Sonia02and02
promised02to02come02himself02in02a02day02or02two02to02see02
Raskolnikov,02mentioning02that02"he02would02like02to02consult02
with02him,02that02there02were02things02they02must02talk02over...."0202
This02conversation02took02place02in02the02passage02on02the02
stairs.02Svidriga07lov02looked02intently02at02Raskolnikov02and02
suddenly,02after02a02brief02pause,02dropping02his02voice,02asked:02
"But02how02is02it,02Rodion02Romanovitch;02you02don't02seem02
yourself?02You02look02and02you02listen,02but02you02don't02seem02to02
understand.02Cheer02up!02We'll02talk02things02over;02I02am02only02
sorry,02I've02so02much02to02do02of02my02own02business02and02other02
people's.02Ah,02Rodion02Romanovitch,"02he02added02suddenly,02
"what02all02men02need02is02fresh02air,02fresh02air...02more02than02
anything!"0202
He02moved02to02one02side02to02make02way02for02the02priest02and02
server,02who02were02coming02up02the02stairs.02They02had02come02for02
the02requiem02service.02By02Svidriga07lov's02orders02it02was02sung02
twice02 a02 day02 punctually.02 Svidriga07lov02 went02 his02 way.02
Raskolnikov02stood02still02a02moment,02thought,02and02followed02
the02priest02into02Sonia's02room.02He02stood02at02the02door.02They02
began02quietly,02slowly02and02mournfully02singing02the02service.02
From02his02childhood02the02thought02of02death02and02the02presence02
of02death02had02something02oppressive02and02mysteriously02
awful;02and02it02was02long02since02he02had02heard02the02requiem02
service.02And02there02was02something02else02here02as02well,02too02
awful02and02disturbing.02He02looked02at02the02children:02they02were02
all02kneeling02by02the02coffin;02Polenka02was02weeping.02Behind02
them02Sonia02prayed,02softly02and,02as02it02were,02timidly02weeping.0202
"These02last02two02days02she02hasn't02said02a02word02to02me,02she02
hasn't02glanced02at02me,"02Raskolnikov02thought02suddenly.02The02
sunlight02was02bright02in02the02room;02the02incense02rose02in02
clouds;02the02priest02read,02"Give02rest,02oh02Lord...."02Raskolnikov02
stayed02all02through02the02service.02As02he02blessed02them02and02
took02his02leave,02the02priest02looked02round02strangely.02After02the02
service,02Raskolnikov02went02up02to02Sonia.02She02took02both02his02
hands02and02let02her02head02sink02on02his02shoulder.02This02slight02
friendly02 gesture02 bewildered02 Raskolnikov.02 It02 seemed02
strange02to02him02that02there02was02no02trace02of02repugnance,02no02
trace02of02disgust,02no02tremor02in02her02hand.02It02was02the02furthest02
limit02of02self\abnegation,02at02least02so02he02interpreted02it.0202
Sonia02said02nothing.02Raskolnikov02pressed02her02hand02and02
went02out.02He02felt02very02miserable.02If02it02had02been02possible02to02
escape02to02some02solitude,02he02would02have02thought02himself02
lucky,02even02if02he02had02to02spend02his02whole02life02there.02But02
although02he02had02almost02always02been02by02himself02of02late,02he02
had02never02been02able02to02feel02alone.02Sometimes02he02walked02
out02of02the02town02on02to02the02high02road,02once02he02had02even02
reached02a02little02wood,02but02the02lonelier02the02place02was,02the02
more02he02seemed02to02be02aware02of02an02uneasy02presence02near02
him.02It02did02not02frighten02him,02but02greatly02annoyed02him,02so02
that02he02made02haste02to02return02to02the02town,02to02mingle02with02
the02crowd,02to02enter02restaurants02and02taverns,02to02walk02in02
busy02thoroughfares.02There02he02felt02easier02and02even02more02
solitary.02One02day02at02dusk02he02sat02for02an02hour02listening02to02
songs02in02a02tavern02and02he02remembered02that02he02positively02
enjoyed02it.02But02at02last02he02had02suddenly02felt02the02same02
uneasiness02again,02as02though02his02conscience02smote02him.02
"Here02I02sit02listening02to02singing,02is02that02what02I02ought02to02be02
doing?"02he02thought.02Yet02he02felt02at02once02that02that02was02not02
the02only02cause02of02his02uneasiness;02there02was02something02
requiring02immediate02decision,02but02it02was02something02he02
could02not02clearly02understand02or02put02into02words.02It02was02a02
hopeless02tangle.02"No,02better02the02struggle02again!02Better02
Porfiry02again...02or02Svidriga07lov....02Better02some02challenge02
again...02some02attack.02Yes,02yes!"02he02thought.02He02went02out02of02
the02tavern02and02rushed02away02almost02at02a02run.02The02thought02
of02Dounia02and02his02mother02suddenly02reduced02him02almost02to02
a02panic.02That02night02he02woke02up02before02morning02among02
some02bushes02in02Krestovsky02Island,02trembling02all02over02with02
fever;02he02walked02home,02and02it02was02early02morning02when02he02
arrived.02After02some02hours'02sleep02the02fever02left02him,02but02he02
woke02up02late,02two02o'clock02in02the02afternoon.0202
He02remembered02that02Katerina02Ivanovna's02funeral02had02
been02fixed02for02that02day,02and02was02glad02that02he02was02not02
present02at02it.02Nastasya02brought02him02some02food;02he02ate02and02
drank02with02appetite,02almost02with02greediness.02His02head02was02
fresher02and02he02was02calmer02than02he02had02been02for02the02last02
three02days.02He02even02felt02a02passing02wonder02at02his02previous02
attacks02of02panic.0202
The02door02opened02and02Razumihin02came02in.0202
"Ah,02he's02eating,02then02he's02not02ill,"02said02Razumihin.02He02
took02 a02 chair02 and02 sat02 down02 at02 the02 table02 opposite02
Raskolnikov.0202
He02was02troubled02and02did02not02attempt02to02conceal02it.02He02
spoke02with02evident02annoyance,02but02without02hurry02or02
raising02his02voice.02He02looked02as02though02he02had02some02special02
fixed02determination.0202
"Listen,"02he02began02resolutely.02"As02far02as02I02am02concerned,02
you02may02all02go02to02hell,02but02from02what02I02see,02it's02clear02to02me02

could02treat02them02as02you02have;02so02you02must02be02mad."0202
"When02did02you02see02them02last?"0202
"Just02now.02Haven't02you02seen02them02since02then?02What02

weren't02here;02she02sat02down,02and02stayed02ten02minutes,02while02
we02stood02waiting02in02silence.02She02got02up02and02said:02'If02he's02

all02of02you,02for02there's02some02mystery,02some02secret02about02it,02
and02I02don't02intend02to02worry02my02brains02over02your02secrets.02
So02I've02simply02come02to02swear02at02you,"02he02finished,02getting02
up,02"to02relieve02my02mind.02And02I02know02what02to02do02now."0202
"What02do02you02mean02to02do02now?"0202
"What02business02is02it02of02yours02what02I02mean02to02do?"0202
"You02are02going02in02for02a02drinking02bout."0202
"How...02how02did02you02know?"0202
"Why,02it's02pretty02plain."0202
Razumihin02paused02for02a02minute.0202
"You02always02have02been02a02very02rational02person02and02
you've02never02been02mad,02never,"02he02observed02suddenly02
with02warmth.02"You're02right:02I02shall02drink.02Good\bye!"0202
And02he02moved02to02go02out.0202
"I02 was02 talking02 with02 my02 sister―the02 day02 before02
yesterday,02I02think02it02was―about02you,02Razumihin."0202
"About02me!02But...02where02can02you02have02seen02her02the02day02
before02yesterday?"02Razumihin02stopped02short02and02even02
turned02a02little02pale.0202
One02could02see02that02his02heart02was02throbbing02slowly02and02
violently.0202
"She02came02here02by02herself,02sat02there02and02talked02to02me."0202
"She02did!"0202
"Yes."0202
"What02did02you02say02to02her...02I02mean,02about02me?"0202
"I02told02her02you02were02a02very02good,02honest,02and02
industrious02man.02I02didn't02tell02her02you02love02her,02because02she02
knows02that02herself."0202
"She02knows02that02herself?"0202
"Well,02it's02pretty02plain.02Wherever02I02might02go,02whatever02
happened02to02me,02you02would02remain02to02look02after02them.02I,02so02
to02speak,02give02them02into02your02keeping,02Razumihin.02I02say02
this02because02I02know02quite02well02how02you02love02her,02and02am02
convinced02of02the02purity02of02your02heart.02I02know02that02she02too02
may02love02you02and02perhaps02does02love02you02already.02Now02
decide02for02yourself,02as02you02know02best,02whether02you02need02
go02in02for02a02drinking02bout02or02not."0202
"Rodya!02You02see...02well....02Ach,02damn02it!02But02where02do02
you02mean02to02go?02Of02course,02if02it's02all02a02secret,02never02mind....02
But02I...02I02shall02find02out02the02secret...02and02I02am02sure02that02it02
must02be02some02ridiculous02nonsense02and02that02you've02made02it02
all02up.02Anyway02you02are02a02capital02fellow,02a02capital02fellow!..."0202
"That02was02just02what02I02wanted02to02add,02only02you02
interrupted,02that02that02was02a02very02good02decision02of02yours02
not02to02find02out02these02secrets.02Leave02it02to02time,02don't02worry02
about02it.02You'll02know02it02all02in02time02when02it02must02be.02
Yesterday02a02man02said02to02me02that02what02a02man02needs02is02fresh02
air,02fresh02air,02fresh02air.02I02mean02to02go02to02him02directly02to02find02
out02what02he02meant02by02that."0202
Razumihin02stood02lost02in02thought02and02excitement,02
making02a02silent02conclusion.0202
"He's02a02political02conspirator!02He02must02be.02And02he's02on02
the02eve02of02some02desperate02step,02that's02certain.02It02can02only02
be02that!02And...02and02Dounia02knows,"02he02thought02suddenly.0202
"So02Avdotya02Romanovna02comes02to02see02you,"02he02said,02
weighing02each02syllable,02"and02you're02going02to02see02a02man02
who02says02we02need02more02air,02and02so02of02course02that02letter...02
that02too02must02have02something02to02do02with02it,"02he02concluded02
to02himself.0202
"What02letter?"0202
"She02got02a02letter02to\day.02It02upset02her02very02much―very02
much02indeed.02Too02much02so.02I02began02speaking02of02you,02she02
begged02me02not02to.02Then...02then02she02said02that02perhaps02we02
should02very02soon02have02to02part...02then02she02began02warmly02
thanking02me02for02something;02then02she02went02to02her02room02
and02locked02herself02in."0202
"She02got02a02letter?"02Raskolnikov02asked02thoughtfully.0202
"Yes,02and02you02didn't02know?02hm..."0202
They02were02both02silent.0202
"Good\bye,02Rodion.02There02was02a02time,02brother,02when02I....02
Never02mind,02good\bye.02You02see,02there02was02a02time....02Well,02
good\bye!02I02must02be02off02too.02I02am02not02going02to02drink.02
There's02no02need02now....02That's02all02stuff!"0202
He02hurried02out;02but02when02he02had02almost02closed02the02
door02behind02him,02he02suddenly02opened02it02again,02and02said,02
looking02away:0202
"Oh,02by02the02way,02do02you02remember02that02murder,02you02
know02Porfiry's,02that02old02woman?02Do02you02know02the02
murderer02has02been02found,02he02has02confessed02and02given02the02
proofs.02It's02one02of02those02very02workmen,02the02painter,02only02
fancy!02Do02you02remember02I02defended02them02here?02Would02
you02believe02it,02all02that02scene02of02fighting02and02laughing02with02
his02companions02on02the02stairs02while02the02porter02and02the02two02
witnesses02were02going02up,02he02got02up02on02purpose02to02disarm02
suspicion.02The02cunning,02the02presence02of02mind02of02the02young02
dog!02One02can02hardly02credit02it;02but02it's02his02own02explanation,02
he02has02confessed02it02all.02And02what02a02fool02I02was02about02it!02Well,02
he's02simply02a02genius02of02hypocrisy02and02resourcefulness02in02
disarming02the02suspicions02of02the02lawyers―so02there's02
nothing02much02to02wonder02at,02I02suppose!02Of02course02people02
like02that02are02always02possible.02And02the02fact02that02he02couldn't02
keep02up02the02character,02but02confessed,02makes02him02easier02to02
believe02in.02But02what02a02fool02I02was!02I02was02frantic02on02their02
side!"0202
"Tell02me,02please,02from02whom02did02you02hear02that,02and02why02
does02
interest02 you02 so?"02 Raskolnikov02 asked02 with02
it02
unmistakable02agitation.0202
"What02next?02You02ask02me02why02it02interests02me!...02Well,02I02
heard02it02from02Porfiry,02among02others...02It02was02from02him02I02
heard02almost02all02about02it."0202
"From02Porfiry?"0202
"From02Porfiry."0202
"What...02what02did02he02say?"02Raskolnikov02asked02in02
dismay.0202
"He02gave02me02a02capital02explanation02of02it.02Psychologically,02
after02his02fashion."0202
"He02explained02it?02Explained02it02himself?"0202
"Yes,02yes;02good\bye.02I'll02tell02you02all02about02it02another02
time,02but02now02I'm02busy.02There02was02a02time02when02I02fancied...02
But02no02matter,02another02time!...02What02need02is02there02for02me02
to02drink02now?02You02have02made02me02drunk02without02wine.02I02
am02drunk,02Rodya!02Good\bye,02I'm02going.02I'll02come02again02very02
soon."0202He02went02out.0202
"He's02a02political02conspirator,02there's02not02a02doubt02about02
it,"02Razumihin02decided,02as02he02slowly02descended02the02stairs.02
"And02he's02drawn02his02sister02in;02that's02quite,02quite02in02keeping02
character.02 There02 are02
with02 Avdotya02 Romanovna's02
interviews02between02them!...02She02hinted02at02it02too...02So02many02
of02her02words....02and02hints...02bear02that02meaning!02And02how02
else02can02all02this02tangle02be02explained?02Hm!02And02I02was02almost02
thinking...02Good02heavens,02what02I02thought!02Yes,02I02took02leave02
of02my02senses02and02I02wronged02him!02It02was02his02doing,02under02
the02lamp02in02the02corridor02that02day.02Pfoo!02What02a02crude,02
nasty,02vile02idea02on02my02part!02Nikolay02is02a02brick,02for02

perhaps.02Whom02was02it02from?02I02suspect...!02No,02I02must02find02
out!"0202He02thought02of02Dounia,02realising02all02he02had02heard02and02his02
heart02throbbed,02and02he02suddenly02broke02into02a02run.0202
As02soon02as02Razumihin02went02out,02Raskolnikov02got02up,02
turned02to02the02window,02walked02into02one02corner02and02then02
into02another,02as02though02forgetting02the02smallness02of02his02
room,02and02sat02down02again02on02the02sofa.02He02felt,02so02to02speak,02
renewed;02again02the02struggle,02so02a02means02of02escape02had02
come.0202
"Yes,02a02means02of02escape02had02come!02It02had02been02too02
stifling,02too02cramping,02the02burden02had02been02too02agonising.02
A02lethargy02had02come02upon02him02at02times.02From02the02moment02
of02the02scene02with02Nikolay02at02Porfiry's02he02had02been02
suffocating,02penned02in02without02hope02of02escape.02After02

with02Sonia;02his02behaviour02and02his02last02words02had02been02
utterly02 unlike02 anything02 he02 could02 have02
imagined02
beforehand;02 he02 had02 grown02
instantly02 and02
feebler,02
fundamentally!02And02he02had02agreed02at02the02time02with02Sonia,02

with02such02a02thing02on02his02mind!0202
"And02Svidriga07lov02was02a02riddle...02He02worried02him,02that02
was02true,02but02somehow02not02on02the02same02point.02He02might02
still02have02a02struggle02to02come02with02Svidriga07lov.02Svidriga07lov,02
too,02might02be02a02means02of02escape;02but02Porfiry02was02a02
different02matter.0202
"And02so02Porfiry02himself02had02explained02it02to02Razumihin,02

which02could02have02only02 one02explanation?02(During02those02
days02Raskolnikov02had02often02recalled02passages02in02that02scene02

morning―too02long02a02time―and02no02sight02nor02sound02of02
Porfiry.02Well,02that02was02a02bad02sign...."0202
Raskolnikov02took02his02cap02and02went02out02of02the02room,02still02
pondering.02It02was02the02first02time02for02a02long02while02that02he02had02
felt02clear02in02his02mind,02at02least.02"I02must02settle02Svidriga07lov,"02
he02thought,02"and02as02soon02as02possible;02he,02too,02seems02to02be02
waiting02for02me02to02come02to02him02of02my02own02accord."02And02at02
that02moment02there02was02such02a02rush02of02hate02in02his02weary02
heart02that02he02might02have02killed02either02of02those02two―
Porfiry02or02Svidriga07lov.02At02least02he02felt02that02he02would02be02
capable02of02doing02it02later,02if02not02now.0202
"We02shall02see,02we02shall02see,"02he02repeated02to02himself.0202
But02no02sooner02had02he02opened02the02door02than02he02
stumbled02upon02Porfiry02himself02in02the02passage.02He02was02
coming02in02to02see02him.02Raskolnikov02was02dumbfounded02for02a02
minute,02but02only02for02one02minute.02Strange02to02say,02he02was02not02
very02much02astonished02at02seeing02Porfiry02and02scarcely02afraid02
of02him.02He02was02simply02startled,02but02was02quickly,02instantly,02
on02his02guard.02"Perhaps02this02will02mean02the02end?02But02how02
could02Porfiry02have02approached02so02quietly,02like02a02cat,02so02that02
he02had02heard02nothing?02Could02he02have02been02listening02at02the02
door?"0202
"You02didn't02expect02a02visitor,02Rodion02Romanovitch,"02
Porfiry02explained,02laughing.02"I've02been02meaning02to02look02in02a02
long02time;02I02was02passing02by02and02thought02why02not02go02in02for02
five02minutes.02Are02you02going02out?02I02won't02keep02you02long.02
Just02let02me02have02one02cigarette."0202
"Sit02down,02Porfiry02Petrovitch,02sit02down."02Raskolnikov02
gave02his02visitor02a02seat02with02so02pleased02and02friendly02an02
expression02that02he02would02have02marvelled02at02himself,02if02he02
could02have02seen02it.0202
The02last02moment02had02come,02the02last02drops02had02to02be02

throat02at02last,02he02feels02no02fear.0202
Raskolnikov02seated02himself02directly02facing02Porfiry,02and02
looked02at02him02without02flinching.02Porfiry02screwed02up02his02
eyes02and02began02lighting02a02cigarette.0202
"Speak,02speak,"02seemed02as02though02it02would02burst02from02
Raskolnikov's02heart.02"Come,02why02don't02you02speak?"0202
02
0202
"Ah02these02cigarettes!"02Porfiry02Petrovitch02ejaculated02at02
last,02having02lighted02one.02"They02are02pernicious,02positively02

"Why,02he's02playing02his02professional02tricks02again,"02
Raskolnikov02thought02with02disgust.02All02the02circumstances02of02
their02last02interview02suddenly02came02back02to02him,02and02he02felt02
a02rush02of02the02feeling02that02had02come02upon02him02then.0202
"I02came02to02see02you02the02day02before02yesterday,02in02the02
evening;02you02didn't02know?"02Porfiry02Petrovitch02went02on,02
looking02round02the02room.02"I02came02into02this02very02room.02I02was02
passing02by,02just02as02I02did02to\day,02and02I02thought02I'd02return02
your02call.02I02walked02in02as02your02door02was02wide02open,02I02looked02
round,02waited02and02went02out02without02leaving02my02name02with02
your02servant.02Don't02you02lock02your02door?"0202
Raskolnikov's02face02grew02more02and02more02gloomy.02
Porfiry02seemed02to02guess02his02state02of02mind.0202
"I've02 come02
it02 out02 with02 you,02 Rodion02
to02 have02
Romanovitch,02my02dear02fellow!02I02owe02you02an02explanation02
and02must02give02it02to02you,"02he02continued02with02a02slight02smile,02
just02patting02Raskolnikov's02knee.0202
But02almost02at02the02same02instant02a02serious02and02careworn02
look02came02into02his02face;02to02his02surprise02Raskolnikov02saw02a02
touch02of02sadness02in02it.02He02had02never02seen02and02never02
suspected02such02an02expression02in02his02face.0202
"A02strange02scene02passed02between02us02last02time02we02met,02
Rodion02Romanovitch.02Our02first02interview,02too,02was02a02
strange02one;02but02then...02and02one02thing02after02another!02This02is02
the02point:02I02have02perhaps02acted02unfairly02to02you;02I02feel02it.02Do02
you02 remember02 how02 we02 parted?02 Your02 nerves02 were02
unhinged02and02your02knees02were02shaking02and02so02were02mine.02

ungentlemanly.02And02yet02we02are02gentlemen,02above02all,02in02

it02 was02 quite02

indecorous."0202
"What02is02he02up02to,02what02does02he02take02me02for?"02
Raskolnikov02asked02himself02in02amazement,02raising02his02head02
and02looking02with02open02eyes02on02Porfiry.0202
"I've02decided02openness02is02better02between02us,"02Porfiry02
Petrovitch02went02on,02turning02his02head02away02and02dropping02
his02eyes,02as02though02unwilling02to02disconcert02his02former02
victim02and02as02though02disdaining02his02former02wiles.02"Yes,02
such02suspicions02and02such02scenes02cannot02continue02for02long.02

that,02of02course;02and02I02am02aware02that02he02came02to02you02

"But02what02are02you02driving02at02now?"02Raskolnikov02
muttered02at02last,02asking02the02question02without02thinking.0202
"What02is02he02talking02about?"02he02wondered02distractedly,02
"does02he02really02take02me02to02be02innocent?"0202
"What02am02I02driving02at?02I've02come02to02explain02myself,02I02

Raskolnikov02shuddered02as02though02he02had02been02stabbed.0202
"Then...02who02then...02is02the02murderer?"02he02asked02in02a02
breathless02voice,02unable02to02restrain02himself.0202
Porfiry02Petrovitch02sank02back02in02his02chair,02as02though02he02
were02amazed02at02the02question.0202
"Who02is02the02murderer?"02he02repeated,02as02though02unable02
to02believe02his02ears.02"Why,02you,02Rodion02Romanovitch!02You02
are02the02murderer,"02he02added,02almost02in02a02whisper,02in02a02
voice02of02genuine02conviction.0202
Raskolnikov02leapt02from02the02sofa,02stood02up02for02a02few02
seconds02and02sat02down02again02without02uttering02a02word.02His02
face02twitched02convulsively.0202
"Your02lip02is02twitching02just02as02it02did02before,"02Porfiry02
Petrovitch02observed02almost02sympathetically.02"You've02been02
misunderstanding02me,02I02think,02Rodion02Romanovitch,"02he02
added02after02a02brief02pause,02"that's02why02you02are02so02surprised.02
I02came02on02purpose02to02tell02you02everything02and02deal02openly02
with02you."0202
"It02was02not02I02murdered02her,"02Raskolnikov02whispered02
like02a02frightened02child02caught02in02the02act.0202
"No,02it02was02you,02you02Rodion02Romanovitch,02and02no02one02
else,"02Porfiry02whispered02sternly,02with02conviction.0202
They02were02both02silent02and02the02silence02lasted02strangely02
long,02about02ten02minutes.02Raskolnikov02put02his02elbow02on02the02
table02and02passed02his02fingers02through02his02hair.02Porfiry02
Petrovitch02sat02quietly02waiting.02Suddenly02Raskolnikov02
looked02scornfully02at02Porfiry.0202
"You02are02at02your02old02tricks02again,02Porfiry02Petrovitch!02
Your02old02method02again.02I02wonder02you02don't02get02sick02of02it!"0202
"Oh,02stop02that,02what02does02that02matter02now?02It02would02be02
a02different02matter02if02there02were02witnesses02present,02but02we02
are02whispering02alone.02You02see02yourself02that02I02have02not02
come02to02chase02and02capture02you02like02a02hare.02Whether02you02
confess02it02or02not02is02nothing02to02me02now;02for02myself,02I02am02
convinced02without02it."0202
"If02so,02what02did02you02come02for?"02Raskolnikov02asked02
irritably.02"I02ask02you02the02same02question02again:02if02you02
consider02me02guilty,02why02don't02you02take02me02to02prison?"0202
"Oh,02that's02your02question!02I02will02answer02you,02point02for02
point.02In02the02first02place,02to02arrest02you02so02directly02is02not02to02
my02interest."0202
"How02so?02If02you02are02convinced02you02ought...."0202
times02 already02
"Ach,02what02if02I02am02convinced?02That's02only02my02dream02for02
the02time.02Why02should02I02put02you02in02safety?02You02know02that's02
it,02since02you02ask02me02to02do02it.02If02I02confront02you02with02that02
workman02for02instance02and02you02say02to02him02'were02you02drunk02
or02not?02Who02saw02me02with02you?02I02simply02took02you02to02be02

while02you02hit02the02mark02exactly,02for02the02rascal02is02an02
inveterate02drunkard02and02notoriously02so.02And02I02have02myself02

though02I02shall02put02you02in02prison02and02indeed02have02come―
it02

quite02 contrary02
beforehand,02yet02I02tell02you02frankly,02also02contrary02to02
etiquette,02that02it02won't02be02to02my02advantage.02Well,02secondly,02
I've02come02to02you02because..."0202
listening02
"Yes,02 yes,02 secondly?"02 Raskolnikov02 was02
breathless.0202
"Because,02as02I02told02you02just02now,02I02consider02I02owe02you02an02
explanation.02I02don't02want02you02to02look02upon02me02as02a02

believe02me02or02not.02And02in02the02third02place02I've02come02to02you02
with02a02direct02and02open02proposition―that02you02should02
surrender02and02confess.02It02will02be02infinitely02more02to02your02
advantage02and02to02my02advantage02too,02for02my02task02will02be02
done.02Well,02is02this02open02on02my02part02or02not?"0202
Raskolnikov02thought02a02minute.0202
"Listen,02Porfiry02Petrovitch.02You02said02just02now02you02have02
nothing02but02psychology02to02go02on,02yet02now02you've02gone02on02
to02 etiquette―to02
mathematics.02Well,02what02if02you02are02mistaken02yourself,02
now?"0202
"No,02Rodion02Romanovitch,02I02am02not02mistaken.02I02have02a02
little02fact02even02then,02Providence02sent02it02me."0202
"What02little02fact?"0202
"I02won't02tell02you02what,02Rodion02Romanovitch.02And02in02any02
case,02I02haven't02the02right02to02put02it02off02any02longer,02I02must02
arrest02you.02So02think02it02over:02it02makes02no02difference02to02me02
now02and02so02I02speak02only02for02your02sake.02Believe02me,02it02will02
be02better,02Rodion02Romanovitch."0202
Raskolnikov02smiled02malignantly.0202
"That's02not02simply02ridiculous,02it's02positively02shameless.02
Why,02even02if02I02were02guilty,02which02I02don't02admit,02what02
reason02should02I02have02to02confess,02when02you02tell02me02yourself02
that02I02shall02be02in02greater02safety02in02prison?"0202
"Ah,02Rodion02Romanovitch,02don't02put02too02much02faith02in02
words,02perhaps02prison02will02not02be02altogether02a02restful02

authority02am02I02for02you?02Perhaps,02too,02even02now02I02am02hiding02
something02from02you?02I02can't02lay02bare02everything,02he\he!02
And02how02can02you02ask02what02advantage?02Don't02you02know02
how02it02would02lessen02your02sentence?02You02would02be02
confessing02at02a02moment02when02another02man02has02taken02the02
crime02on02himself02and02so02has02muddled02the02whole02case.02

that02your02confession02shall02come02as02a02complete02surprise.02

points,02of02a02suspicion02against02you,02so02that02your02crime02will02
appear02to02have02been02something02like02an02aberration,02for02in02
truth02it02was02an02aberration.02I02am02an02honest02man,02Rodion02
Romanovitch,02and02will02keep02my02word."0202
Raskolnikov02maintained02a02mournful02silence02and02let02his02
head02sink02dejectedly.02He02pondered02a02long02while02and02at02last02
smiled02again,02but02his02smile02was02sad02and02gentle.0202
"No!"02he02said,02apparently02abandoning02all02attempt02to02
keep02up02appearances02with02Porfiry,02"it's02not02worth02it,02I02don't02
care02about02lessening02the02sentence!"0202
"That's02just02what02I02was02afraid02of!"02Porfiry02cried02warmly02
and,02as02it02seemed,02involuntarily.02"That's02just02what02I02feared,02
that02you02wouldn't02care02about02the02mitigation02of02sentence."0202
Raskolnikov02looked02sadly02and02expressively02at02him.0202
"Ah,02don't02disdain02life!"02Porfiry02went02on.02"You02have02a02
great02deal02of02it02still02before02you.02How02can02you02say02you02don't02
want02a02mitigation02of02sentence?02You02are02an02impatient02

"A02great02deal02of02what02lies02before02me?"0202
"Of02life.02What02sort02of02prophet02are02you,02do02you02know02
much02about02it?02Seek02and02ye02shall02find.02This02may02be02God's02
means02for02bringing02you02to02Him.02And02it's02not02for02ever,02the02
bondage...."0202
"The02time02will02be02shortened,"02laughed02Raskolnikov.0202
"Why,02is02it02the02bourgeois02disgrace02you02are02afraid02of?02It02
may02be02that02you02are02afraid02of02it02without02knowing02it,02
because02you02are02young!02But02anyway02 you02shouldn't02be02
afraid02of02giving02yourself02up02and02confessing."0202
"Ach,02hang02it!"02Raskolnikov02whispered02with02loathing02
and02contempt,02as02though02he02did02not02want02to02speak02aloud.0202
He02got02up02again02as02though02he02meant02to02go02away,02but02sat02
down02again02in02evident02despair.0202
"Hang02it,02if02you02like!02You've02lost02faith02and02you02think02that02

Raskolnikov02positively02started.0202

far.02If02anything02happens,02I02have02one02request02to02make02of02
you,"02he02added,02dropping02his02voice.02"It's02an02awkward02one,02
but02important.02If02anything02were02to02happen02(though02indeed02
I02don't02believe02in02it02and02think02you02quite02incapable02of02it),02yet02

Raskolnikov.02The02latter02went02to02the02window02and02waited02
with02irritable02impatience02till02he02calculated02that02Porfiry02had02
reached02the02street02and02moved02away.02Then02he02too02went02
hurriedly02out02of02the02room.0202

CHAPTER02III0202
He02hurried02to02Svidriga07lov's.02What02he02had02to02hope02from02
that02man02he02did02not02know.02But02that02man02had02some02hidden02
power02over02him.02Having02once02recognised02this,02he02could02not02
rest,02and02now02the02time02had02come.0202
On02the02way,02one02question02particularly02worried02him:02had02
Svidriga07lov02been02to02Porfiry's?0202
As02far02as02he02could02judge,02he02would02swear02to02it,02that02he02
had02not.02He02pondered02again02and02again,02went02over02Porfiry's02
visit;02no,02he02hadn't02been,02of02course02he02hadn't.0202
But02if02he02had02not02been02yet,02would02he02go?02Meanwhile,02for02
the02present02he02fancied02he02couldn't.02Why?02He02could02not02
have02explained,02but02if02he02could,02he02would02not02have02wasted02
much02thought02over02it02at02the02moment.02It02all02worried02him02
and02at02the02same02time02he02could02not02attend02to02it.02Strange02to02
important02 anxiety02
say,02none02would02have02believed02it02perhaps,02but02he02only02felt02
a02faint02vague02anxiety02about02his02immediate02future.02Another,02
much02 more02
tormented02 him―it02
concerned02himself,02but02in02a02different,02more02vital02way.02
Moreover,02he02was02conscious02of02immense02moral02fatigue,02
though02his02mind02was02working02better02that02morning02than02it02
had02done02of02late.0202
And02was02it02worth02while,02after02all02that02had02happened,02to02
contend02with02these02new02trivial02difficulties?02Was02it02worth02
while,02for02instance,02to02manoeuvre02that02Svidriga07lov02should02
not02go02to02Porfiry's?02Was02it02worth02while02to02investigate,02to02
ascertain02the02facts,02to02waste02time02over02anyone02like02
Svidriga07lov?0202
Oh,02how02sick02he02was02of02it02all!0202
And02yet02he02was02hastening02to02Svidriga07lov;02could02he02be02
expecting02something02new02from02him,02information,02or02means02
of02escape?02Men02will02catch02at02straws!02Was02it02destiny02or02
some02instinct02bringing02them02together?02Perhaps02it02was02only02
fatigue,02despair;02perhaps02it02was02not02Svidriga07lov02but02some02
other02whom02he02needed,02and02Svidriga07lov02had02simply02
presented02himself02by02chance.02Sonia?02But02what02should02he02
go02to02Sonia02for02now?02To02beg02her02tears02again?02He02was02afraid02
of02Sonia,02too.02Sonia02stood02before02him02as02an02irrevocable02
sentence.02He02must02go02his02own02way02or02hers.02At02that02moment02
especially02he02did02not02feel02equal02to02seeing02her.02No,02would02it02
not02be02better02to02try02Svidriga07lov?02And02he02could02not02help02
inwardly02owning02that02he02had02long02felt02that02he02must02see02him02
for02some02reason.0202
But02what02could02they02have02in02common?02Their02very02evil\
doing02could02not02be02of02the02same02kind.02The02man,02moreover,02
was02very02unpleasant,02evidently02depraved,02undoubtedly02
cunning02and02deceitful,02possibly02malignant.02Such02stories02
were02told02about02him.02It02is02true02he02was02befriending02Katerina02
Ivanovna's02children,02but02who02could02tell02with02what02motive02
and02what02it02meant?02The02man02always02had02some02design,02
some02project.0202
There02was02another02thought02which02had02been02continually02
hovering02of02late02about02Raskolnikov's02mind,02and02causing02
him02great02uneasiness.02It02was02so02painful02that02he02made02
distinct02efforts02to02get02rid02of02it.02He02sometimes02thought02that02
Svidriga07lov02was02dogging02his02footsteps.02Svidriga07lov02had02
found02out02his02secret02and02had02had02designs02on02Dounia.02What02
if02he02had02them02still?02Wasn't02it02practically02certain02that02he02
had?02And02what02if,02having02learnt02his02secret02and02so02having02
gained02power02over02him,02he02were02to02use02it02as02a02weapon02
against02Dounia?0202
This02idea02sometimes02even02tormented02his02dreams,02but02it02
had02never02presented02itself02so02vividly02to02him02as02on02his02way02
to02Svidriga07lov.02The02very02thought02moved02him02to02gloomy02
rage.02To02begin02with,02this02would02transform02everything,02even02
his02own02position;02he02would02have02at02once02to02confess02his02
secret02to02Dounia.02Would02he02have02to02give02himself02up02
perhaps02to02prevent02Dounia02from02taking02some02rash02step?02
The02letter?02This02morning02Dounia02had02received02a02letter.02
From02whom02could02she02get02letters02in02Petersburg?02Luzhin,02
perhaps?02It's02true02Razumihin02was02there02to02protect02her,02but02
Razumihin02knew02nothing02of02the02position.02Perhaps02it02was02
his02duty02to02tell02Razumihin?02He02thought02of02it02with02
repugnance.0202
In02any02case02he02must02see02Svidriga07lov02as02soon02as02
possible,02he02decided02finally.02Thank02God,02the02details02of02the02
interview02were02of02little02consequence,02if02only02he02could02get02at02
the02root02of02the02matter;02but02if02Svidriga07lov02were02capable...02if02
he02were02intriguing02against02Dounia―then...0202
Raskolnikov02was02so02exhausted02by02what02he02had02passed02
through02that02month02that02he02could02only02decide02such02
questions02in02one02way;02"then02I02shall02kill02him,"02he02thought02in02
cold02despair.0202
A02sudden02anguish02oppressed02his02heart,02he02stood02still02in02
the02middle02of02the02street02and02began02looking02about02to02see02
where02he02was02and02which02way02he02was02going.02He02found02
himself02in02X.02Prospect,02thirty02or02forty02paces02from02the02Hay02
Market,02through02which02he02had02come.02The02whole02second02
storey02of02the02house02on02the02left02was02used02as02a02tavern.02All02the02
windows02were02wide02open;02judging02from02the02figures02
full02 to02
moving02 at02 the02 windows,02 the02 rooms02 were02
overflowing.02There02were02sounds02of02singing,02of02clarionet02
and02violin,02and02the02boom02of02a02Turkish02drum.02He02could02hear02
women02shrieking.02He02was02about02to02turn02back02wondering02
why02he02had02come02to02the02X.02Prospect,02when02suddenly02at02one02
of02the02end02windows02he02saw02Svidriga07lov,02sitting02at02a02tea\
table02right02in02the02open02window02with02a02pipe02in02his02mouth.02
Raskolnikov02was02dreadfully02taken02aback,02almost02terrified.02
Svidriga07lov02was02silently02watching02and02scrutinising02him02
and,02what02struck02Raskolnikov02at02once,02seemed02to02be02
meaning02to02get02up02and02slip02away02unobserved.02Raskolnikov02
at02once02pretended02not02to02have02seen02him,02but02to02be02looking02
absent\mindedly02away,02while02he02watched02him02out02of02the02
corner02of02his02eye.02His02heart02was02beating02violently.02Yet,02it02
was02evident02that02Svidriga07lov02did02not02want02to02be02seen.02He02
took02the02pipe02out02of02his02mouth02and02was02on02the02point02of02
concealing02himself,02but02as02he02got02up02and02moved02back02his02
chair,02he02seemed02to02have02become02suddenly02aware02that02
Raskolnikov02had02seen02him,02and02was02watching02him.02What02
had02passed02between02them02was02much02the02same02as02what02
happened02at02their02first02meeting02in02Raskolnikov's02room.02A02
sly02smile02came02into02Svidriga07lov's02face02and02grew02broader02
and02broader.02Each02knew02that02he02was02seen02and02watched02by02
the02other.02At02last02Svidriga07lov02broke02into02a02loud02laugh.0202
"Well,02well,02come02in02if02you02want02me;02I02am02here!"02he02
shouted02from02the02window.0202
into02 the02 tavern.02 He02 found02
Raskolnikov02 went02 up02
Svidriga07lov02in02a02tiny02back02room,02adjoining02the02saloon02in02
which02merchants,02clerks02and02numbers02of02people02of02all02sorts02
were02drinking02tea02at02twenty02little02tables02to02the02desperate02
bawling02of02a02chorus02of02singers.02The02click02of02billiard02balls02
could02be02heard02in02the02distance.02On02the02table02before02
Svidriga07lov02stood02an02open02bottle02and02a02glass02half02full02of02
champagne.02In02the02room02he02found02also02a02boy02with02a02little02
hand02 organ,02 a02 healthy\looking02 red\cheeked02 girl02 of02
eighteen,02wearing02a02tucked\up02striped02skirt,02and02a02Tyrolese02
hat02with02ribbons.02In02spite02of02the02chorus02in02the02other02room,02
she02was02singing02some02servants'02hall02song02in02a02rather02husky02
contralto,02to02the02accompaniment02of02the02organ.0202
"Come,02that's02enough,"02Svidriga07lov02stopped02her02at02
Raskolnikov's02entrance.02The02girl02at02once02broke02off02and02
stood02waiting02respectfully.02She02had02sung02her02guttural02
rhymes,02too,02with02a02serious02and02respectful02expression02in02
her02face.0202
"Hey,02Philip,02a02glass!"02shouted02Svidriga07lov.0202
"I02won't02drink02anything,"02said02Raskolnikov.0202
"As02you02like,02I02didn't02mean02it02for02you.02Drink,02Katia!02I02
don't02want02anything02more02to\day,02you02can02go."02He02poured02
her02out02a02full02glass,02and02laid02down02a02yellow02note.0202
Katia02drank02off02her02glass02of02wine,02as02women02do,02without02
putting02it02down,02in02twenty02gulps,02took02the02note02and02kissed02
Svidriga07lov's02hand,02which02he02allowed02quite02seriously.02She02
went02out02of02the02room02and02the02boy02trailed02after02her02with02the02
organ.02Both02had02been02brought02in02 from02the02street.02
Svidriga07lov02had02not02been02a02week02in02Petersburg,02but02
everything02about02him02was02already,02so02to02speak,02on02a02
patriarchal02footing;02the02waiter,02Philip,02was02by02now02an02old02
friend02and02very02obsequious.0202
The02door02leading02to02the02saloon02had02a02lock02on02it.02
Svidriga07lov02was02at02home02in02this02room02and02perhaps02spent02
whole02days02in02it.02The02tavern02was02dirty02and02wretched,02not02
even02second\rate.0202
"I02was02going02to02see02you02and02
looking02for02you,"02
Raskolnikov02began,02"but02I02don't02know02what02made02me02turn02
from02the02Hay02Market02into02the02X.02Prospect02just02now.02I02never02
take02this02turning.02I02turn02to02the02right02from02the02Hay02Market.02
And02this02isn't02the02way02to02you.02I02simply02turned02and02here02you02
are.02It02is02strange!"0202
"Why02don't02you02say02at02once02'it's02a02miracle'?"0202
"Because02it02may02be02only02chance."0202
"Oh,02that's02the02way02 with02all02 you02folk,"02
laughed02
Svidriga07lov.02"You02won't02admit02it,02even02if02you02do02inwardly02
believe02it02a02miracle!02Here02you02say02that02it02may02be02only02
chance.02And02what02cowards02they02all02are02here,02about02having02
an02 opinion02 of02 their02 own,02 you02 can't02 fancy,02 Rodion02
Romanovitch.02I02don't02mean02you,02you02have02an02opinion02of02
your02own02and02are02not02afraid02to02have02it.02That's02how02it02was02
you02attracted02my02curiosity."0202
"Nothing02else?"0202
"Well,02that's02enough,02you02know,"02Svidriga07lov02was02
obviously02exhilarated,02but02only02slightly02so,02he02had02not02had02
more02than02half02a02glass02of02wine.0202
"I02fancy02you02came02to02see02me02before02you02knew02that02I02was02
capable02of02having02what02you02call02an02opinion02of02my02own,"02
observed02Raskolnikov.0202
"Oh,02well,02it02was02a02different02matter.02Everyone02has02his02
own02plans.02And02apropos02of02the02miracle02let02me02tell02you02that02
I02think02you02have02been02asleep02for02the02last02two02or02three02days.02
I02told02you02of02this02tavern02myself,02there02is02no02miracle02in02your02
coming02straight02here.02I02explained02the02way02myself,02told02you02
where02it02was,02and02the02hours02you02could02find02me02here.02Do02
you02remember?"0202
"I02 don't02 remember,"02 answered02 Raskolnikov02 with02
surprise.0202
"I02believe02you.02I02told02you02twice.02The02address02has02been02
stamped02mechanically02on02your02memory.02You02turned02this02
way02mechanically02and02yet02precisely02according02to02the02
direction,02though02you02are02not02aware02of02it.02When02I02told02you02
then,02I02hardly02hoped02you02understood02me.02You02give02yourself02
away02too02much,02Rodion02Romanovitch.02And02another02thing,02
I'm02convinced02there02are02lots02of02people02in02Petersburg02who02
talk02to02themselves02as02they02walk.02This02is02a02town02of02crazy02
people.02If02only02we02had02scientific02men,02doctors,02lawyers02and02
philosophers02might02make02most02valuable02investigations02in02
Petersburg02each02in02his02own02line.02There02are02few02places02
where02there02are02so02many02gloomy,02strong02and02queer02
influences02on02the02soul02of02man02as02in02Petersburg.02The02mere02
influences02 of02 climate02 mean02 so02 much.02 And02
it's02 the02
administrative02centre02of02all02Russia02and02its02character02must02
be02reflected02on02the02whole02country.02But02that02is02neither02here02
nor02there02now.02The02point02is02that02I02have02several02times02
watched02you.02You02walk02out02of02your02house―holding02your02
head02high―twenty02paces02from02home02you02let02it02sink,02and02
fold02your02hands02behind02your02back.02You02look02and02evidently02
see02nothing02before02nor02beside02you.02At02last02you02begin02
moving02your02lips02and02talking02to02yourself,02and02sometimes02
you02wave02one02hand02and02declaim,02and02at02last02stand02still02in02
the02middle02of02the02road.02That's02not02at02all02the02thing.02Someone02
may02be02watching02you02besides02me,02and02it02won't02do02you02any02
good.02It's02nothing02really02to02do02with02me02and02I02can't02cure02you,02
but,02of02course,02you02understand02me."0202
"Do02you02know02that02I02am02being02followed?"02asked02
Raskolnikov,02looking02inquisitively02at02him.0202
"No,02I02know02nothing02about02it,"02said02Svidriga07lov,02

"Well,02then,02let02us02leave02me02alone,"02Raskolnikov02
muttered,02frowning.0202
"Very02good,02let02us02leave02you02alone."0202
"You02had02better02tell02me,02if02you02come02here02to02drink,02and02

"He\he!02And02why02was02it02you02lay02on02your02sofa02with02

"And02I02may02have02had02my02reasons,02though02you02don't02

Raskolnikov02dropped02his02right02elbow02on02the02table,02
leaned02his02chin02in02the02fingers02of02his02right02hand,02and02stared02
intently02at02Svidriga07lov.02For02a02full02minute02he02scrutinised02his02
face,02which02had02impressed02him02before.02It02was02a02strange02
face,02like02a02mask;02white02and02red,02with02bright02red02lips,02with02a02
flaxen02beard,02and02still02thick02flaxen02hair.02His02eyes02were02
somehow02too02blue02and02their02expression02somehow02too02
heavy02and02fixed.02There02was02something02awfully02unpleasant02
in02that02handsome02face,02which02looked02so02wonderfully02young02
for02his02age.02Svidriga07lov02was02smartly02dressed02in02light02
summer02clothes02and02was02particularly02dainty02in02his02linen.02
He02wore02a02huge02ring02with02a02precious02stone02in02it.0202
"Have02I02got02to02bother02myself02about02you,02too,02now?"02said02
Raskolnikov02suddenly,02coming02with02nervous02impatience02
straight02to02the02point.02"Even02though02perhaps02you02are02the02

"Why02in02such02haste?"02asked02Svidriga07lov,02looking02at02him02
curiously.0202
"Everyone02 has02 his02 plans,"02 Raskolnikov02 answered02
gloomily02and02impatiently.0202
"You02urged02me02yourself02to02frankness02just02now,02and02at02
the02first02question02you02refuse02to02answer,"02Svidriga07lov02
observed02with02a02smile.02"You02keep02fancying02that02I02have02aims02

it's02perfectly02natural02in02your02position.02But02though02I02should02

special."0202
"What02did02you02want02me,02for,02then?02It02was02you02who02came02
hanging02about02me."0202
"Why,02simply02as02an02interesting02subject02for02observation.02
I02liked02the02fantastic02nature02of02your02position―that's02what02it02

Ha\ha\ha!02Still02I02must02admit02that02your02question02is02rather02
complex,02and02is02difficult02for02me02to02answer.02Here,02you,02for02

Isn't02that02so?"02persisted02Svidriga07lov02with02a02sly02smile.02
"Well,02can't02you02fancy02then02that02I,02too,02on02my02way02here02in02

"What02profit02could02you02make?"0202
"How02can02I02tell02you?02How02do02I02know?02You02see02in02what02a02

trouble02came02in.02But02to02judge02some02people02impartially02we02
must02renounce02certain02preconceived02opinions02and02our02
habitual02attitude02to02the02ordinary02people02about02us.02I02have02
reason02to02have02faith02in02your02judgment02rather02than02in02
anyone's.02Perhaps02you02have02already02heard02a02great02deal02that02
was02ridiculous02and02absurd02about02Marfa02Petrovna.02She02
certainly02had02some02very02ridiculous02ways,02but02I02tell02you02
frankly02that02I02feel02really02sorry02for02the02innumerable02woes02of02
which02I02was02the02cause.02Well,02and02that's02enough,02I02think,02by02
way02of02a02decorous02oraison02funèbre02for02the02most02tender02wife02
of02a02most02tender02husband.02When02we02quarrelled,02I02usually02
held02my02tongue02and02did02not02irritate02her02and02that02
gentlemanly02conduct02rarely02failed02to02attain02its02object,02it02
influenced02her,02it02pleased02her,02indeed.02These02were02times02
when02she02was02positively02proud02of02me.02But02your02sister02she02
couldn't02put02up02with,02anyway.02And02however02she02came02to02
risk02taking02such02a02beautiful02creature02into02her02house02as02a02
governess.02My02explanation02is02that02Marfa02Petrovna02was02an02
ardent02and02impressionable02woman02and02simply02fell02in02love02
herself―literally02fell02in02love―with02your02sister.02Well,02little02
wonder―look02at02Avdotya02Romanovna!02I02saw02the02danger02at02
the02first02glance02and02what02do02you02think,02I02resolved02not02to02
look02at02her02even.02But02Avdotya02Romanovna02herself02made02
the02first02step,02would02you02believe02it?02Would02you02believe02it02
too02that02Marfa02Petrovna02was02positively02angry02with02me02at02
first02for02my02persistent02silence02about02your02sister,02for02my02
careless02reception02of02her02continual02adoring02praises02of02
Avdotya02Romanovna.02I02don't02know02what02it02was02she02
wanted!02Well,02of02course,02Marfa02Petrovna02told02Avdotya02
Romanovna02 every02 detail02 about02 me.02 She02 had02
the02
unfortunate02habit02of02telling02literally02everyone02all02our02
family02secrets02and02continually02complaining02of02me;02how02
could02she02fail02to02confide02in02such02a02delightful02new02friend?02I02
expect02they02talked02of02nothing02else02but02me02and02no02doubt02
Avdotya02Romanovna02heard02all02those02dark02mysterious02
rumours02that02were02current02about02me....02I02don't02mind02
betting02that02you02too02have02heard02something02of02the02sort02
already?"0202
"I02have.02Luzhin02charged02you02with02having02caused02the02
death02of02a02child.02Is02that02true?"0202
"Don't02 refer02 to02 those02 vulgar02 tales,02 I02 beg,"02 said02
Svidriga07lov02with02disgust02and02annoyance.02"If02you02insist02on02
wanting02to02know02about02all02that02idiocy,02I02will02tell02you02one02
day,02but02now..."0202
"I02was02told02too02about02some02footman02of02yours02in02the02
country02whom02you02treated02badly."0202
"I02beg02you02to02drop02the02subject,"02Svidriga07lov02interrupted02
again02with02obvious02impatience.0202
"Was02that02the02footman02who02came02to02you02after02death02to02
fill02your02pipe?...02you02told02me02about02it02yourself."02Raskolnikov02
felt02more02and02more02irritated.0202
Svidriga07lov02looked02at02him02attentively02and02Raskolnikov02
fancied02he02caught02a02flash02of02spiteful02mockery02in02that02look.02
But02Svidriga07lov02restrained02himself02and02answered02very02
civilly:0202
"Yes,02it02was.02I02see02that02you,02too,02are02extremely02interested02
and02shall02feel02it02my02duty02to02satisfy02your02curiosity02at02the02
first02opportunity.02Upon02my02soul!02I02see02that02I02really02might02
pass02for02a02romantic02figure02with02some02people.02Judge02how02
grateful02I02must02be02to02Marfa02Petrovna02for02having02repeated02
to02Avdotya02Romanovna02such02mysterious02and02interesting02
gossip02about02me.02I02dare02not02guess02what02impression02it02made02
on02her,02but02in02any02case02it02worked02in02my02interests.02With02all02
Avdotya02Romanovna's02natural02aversion02and02in02spite02of02my02
invariably02gloomy02and02repellent02aspect―she02did02at02least02
feel02pity02for02me,02pity02for02a02lost02soul.02And02if02once02a02girl's02
heart02is02moved02to02pity,02it's02more02dangerous02than02anything.02
She02is02bound02to02want02to02'save02him,'02to02bring02him02to02his02
senses,02and02lift02him02up02and02draw02him02to02nobler02aims,02and02
restore02him02to02new02life02and02usefulness―well,02we02all02know02
how02far02such02dreams02can02go.02I02saw02at02once02that02the02bird02
was02flying02into02the02cage02of02herself.02And02I02too02made02ready.02I02
think02you02are02frowning,02Rodion02Romanovitch?02There's02no02
need.02As02you02know,02it02all02ended02in02smoke.02(Hang02it02all,02what02
a02lot02I02am02drinking!)02Do02you02know,02I02always,02from02the02very02

a02reigning02prince02or02some02governor02or02pro\consul02in02Asia02
Minor.02She02would02undoubtedly02have02been02one02of02those02
who02would02endure02martyrdom02and02would02have02smiled02
when02they02branded02her02bosom02with02hot02pincers.02And02she02
would02have02gone02to02it02of02herself.02And02in02the02fourth02or02fifth02
century02she02would02have02walked02away02into02the02Egyptian02
desert02and02would02have02stayed02there02thirty02years02living02on02
roots02and02ecstasies02and02visions.02She02is02simply02thirsting02to02
face02some02torture02for02someone,02and02if02she02can't02get02her02
torture,02she'll02throw02herself02out02of02a02window.02I've02heard02
something02of02a02Mr.02Razumihin―he's02said02to02be02a02sensible02
fellow;02his02surname02suggests02it,02indeed.02He's02probably02a02
divinity02student.02Well,02he'd02better02look02after02your02sister!02I02
believe02I02understand02her,02and02I02am02proud02of02it.02But02at02the02
beginning02of02an02acquaintance,02as02you02know,02one02is02apt02to02
be02more02heedless02and02stupid.02One02doesn't02see02clearly.02Hang02
it02all,02why02is02she02so02handsome?02It's02not02my02fault.02In02fact,02it02
began02on02my02side02with02a02most02irresistible02physical02desire.02
Avdotya02Romanovna02is02awfully02chaste,02incredibly02and02
phenomenally02so.02Take02note,02I02tell02you02this02about02your02
sister02as02a02fact.02She02is02almost02morbidly02chaste,02in02spite02of02
her02broad02intelligence,02and02it02will02stand02in02her02way.02There02
happened02to02be02a02girl02in02the02house02then,02Parasha,02a02black\
eyed02wench,02whom02I02had02never02seen02before―she02had02just02
come02from02another02village―very02pretty,02but02incredibly02
stupid:02she02burst02into02tears,02wailed02so02that02she02could02be02
heard02all02over02the02place02and02caused02scandal.02One02day02after02
dinner02Avdotya02Romanovna02followed02me02into02an02avenue02in02
the02garden02and02with02flashing02eyes02 insisted02on02my02leaving02
poor02Parasha02alone.02It02was02almost02our02first02conversation02
by02ourselves.02I,02of02course,02was02only02too02pleased02to02obey02her02
wishes,02tried02to02appear02disconcerted,02embarrassed,02in02fact02
played02 my02 part02 not02 badly.02 Then02 came02
interviews,02
mysterious02
entreaties,02
exhortations,02
supplications,02even02tears―would02you02believe02it,02even02
tears?02Think02what02the02passion02for02propaganda02will02bring02
some02girls02to!02I,02of02course,02threw02it02all02on02my02destiny,02posed02
conversations,02
as02hungering02and02thirsting02for02light,02and02finally02resorted02to02
the02most02powerful02weapon02in02the02subjection02of02the02female02
heart,02a02weapon02which02never02fails02one.02It's02the02well\known02
resource―flattery.02Nothing02in02the02world02is02harder02than02
speaking02the02truth02and02nothing02easier02than02flattery.02If02
there's02the02hundredth02part02of02a02false02note02in02speaking02the02
truth,02it02leads02to02a02discord,02and02that02leads02to02trouble.02But02if02
all,02to02the02last02note,02is02false02in02flattery,02it02is02just02as02
agreeable,02and02is02heard02not02without02satisfaction.02It02may02be02
a02coarse02satisfaction,02but02still02a02satisfaction.02And02however02
coarse02the02flattery,02at02least02half02will02be02sure02to02seem02true.02
That's02so02for02all02stages02of02development02and02classes02of02
society.02A02vestal02virgin02might02be02seduced02by02flattery.02I02can02
never02remember02without02laughter02how02I02once02seduced02a02
lady02who02was02devoted02to02her02husband,02her02children,02and02
her02principles.02What02fun02it02was02and02how02little02trouble!02And02
the02lady02really02had02principles―of02her02own,02anyway.02All02my02
tactics02
in02 simply02 being02 utterly02 annihilated02 and02
prostrate02before02her02purity.02I02flattered02her02shamelessly,02
and02as02soon02as02I02succeeded02in02getting02a02pressure02of02the02
hand,02even02a02glance02from02her,02I02would02reproach02myself02for02

had02resisted,02so02that02I02could02never02have02gained02anything02
but02for02my02being02so02unprincipled.02I02maintained02that02she02
was02so02innocent02that02she02could02not02foresee02my02treachery,02

firmly02
convinced02that02she02was02innocent,02chaste,02and02faithful02to02all02
her02duties02and02obligations02and02had02succumbed02quite02by02

that02she02was02just02as02eager02as02I.02Poor02Marfa02Petrovna02was02

now02that02I02was02beginning02to02produce02the02same02effect02on02
Avdotya02Romanovna.02But02I02was02stupid02and02impatient02and02
spoiled02it02all.02Avdotya02Romanovna02had02several02times―and02
one02time02in02particular―been02greatly02displeased02by02the02
expression02of02my02eyes,02would02you02believe02it?02There02was02
sometimes02a02light02in02them02which02frightened02her02and02grew02
stronger02and02stronger02and02more02unguarded02till02it02was02
hateful02to02her.02No02need02to02go02into02detail,02but02we02parted.02

way02at02all02such02propaganda02and02efforts02to02convert02me;02
Parasha02came02on02to02the02scene02again,02and02not02she02alone;02in02
fact02
there02 was02 a02
to\do.02 Ah,02 Rodion02
Romanovitch,02if02you02could02only02see02how02your02sister's02eyes02
can02flash02sometimes!02Never02mind02my02being02drunk02at02this02
moment02and02having02had02a02whole02glass02of02wine.02I02am02
speaking02the02truth.02I02assure02you02that02this02glance02has02
haunted02my02dreams;02the02very02rustle02of02her02dress02was02more02
than02I02could02stand02at02last.02I02really02began02to02think02that02I02
might02become02epileptic.02I02could02never02have02believed02that02I02
could02be02moved02to02such02a02frenzy.02It02was02essential,02indeed,02
to02be02reconciled,02but02by02then02it02was02impossible.02And02
imagine02what02I02did02then!02To02what02a02pitch02of02stupidity02a02
man02can02be02brought02by02frenzy!02Never02undertake02anything02
in02a02frenzy,02Rodion02Romanovitch.02I02reflected02that02Avdotya02

not02the02word...02but02does02it02matter02if02it02expresses02the02

mother02and02you02to02keep02(ach,02hang02it,02you02are02frowning02
again),02and02I02resolved02to02offer02her02all02my02money―thirty02
thousand02roubles02I02could02have02realised02then―if02she02would02
run02away02with02me02here,02to02Petersburg.02Of02course02I02should02
have02vowed02eternal02love,02rapture,02and02so02on.02Do02you02know,02
I02was02so02wild02about02her02at02that02time02that02if02she02had02told02me02
to02poison02Marfa02Petrovna02or02to02cut02her02throat02and02to02marry02

the02catastrophe02of02which02you02know02already.02You02can02fancy02
how02frantic02I02was02when02I02heard02that02Marfa02Petrovna02had02
got02hold02of02that02scoundrelly02attorney,02Luzhin,02and02had02
almost02made02a02match02between02them―which02would02really02

Wouldn't02it?02Wouldn't02it?02I02notice02that02you've02begun02to02be02
very02attentive...02you02interesting02young02man...."0202
Svidriga07lov02struck02the02table02with02his02fist02impatiently.02

Svidriga07lov.0202
"Well,02after02what02you02have02said,02I02am02fully02convinced02
that02you02have02come02to02Petersburg02with02designs02on02my02

"Are02you02so02sure02that02she02can't?"02Svidriga07lov02screwed02
up02his02eyes02and02smiled02mockingly.02"You02are02right,02she02

"I02dare02say.02I02can02see02I02am02ridiculous02myself,"02muttered02
Raskolnikov02angrily.0202
Svidriga07lov02laughed02heartily;02finally02he02called02Philip,02
paid02his02bill,02and02began02getting02up.0202
"I02say,02but02I02am02drunk,02assez02causé,"02he02said.02"It's02been02a02
pleasure."0202
"I02should02rather02think02it02must02be02a02pleasure!"02cried02
Raskolnikov,02getting02up.02"No02doubt02it02is02a02pleasure02for02a02

"Well,02if02you02come02to02that,"02Svidriga07lov02answered,02

Svidriga07lov02walked02out02of02the02restaurant.02Raskolnikov02
walked02out02after02him.02Svidriga07lov02was02not02however02very02
drunk,02the02wine02had02affected02him02for02a02moment,02but02it02was02
passing02off02every02minute.02He02was02preoccupied02with02
something02of02importance02and02was02frowning.02He02was02
apparently02 excited02 and02 uneasy02
in02 anticipation02 of02
something.02His02manner02to02Raskolnikov02had02changed02
during02the02last02few02minutes,02and02he02was02ruder02and02more02
sneering02every02moment.02Raskolnikov02noticed02all02this,02and02
he02too02was02uneasy.02He02became02very02suspicious02of02
Svidriga07lov02and02resolved02to02follow02him.0202
CHAPTER02V0202
They02came02out02on02to02the02pavement.0202
"You02go02to02the02right,02and02I02to02the02left,02or02if02you02like,02the02

And02he02walked02to02the02right02towards02the02Hay02Market.0202
02
0202
RASKOLNIKOV02WALKED02AFTER02HIM.0202
"What's02this?"02cried02Svidriga07lov02turning02round,02"I02
thought02I02said..."0202
"It02means02that02I02am02not02going02to02lose02sight02of02you02now."0202
"What?"0202
Both02stood02still02and02gazed02at02one02another,02as02though02
measuring02their02strength.0202
"From02all02your02half02tipsy02stories,"02Raskolnikov02observed02
harshly,02"I02am02 positive02that02you02have02not02given02up02your02

means02nothing.02I02should02like02to02make02certain02myself."0202
Raskolnikov02could02hardly02have02said02himself02what02he02
wanted02and02of02what02he02wished02to02make02certain.0202
"Upon02my02word!02I'll02call02the02police!"0202
"Call02away!"0202
Again02they02stood02for02a02minute02facing02each02other.02At02last02
Svidriga07lov's02face02changed.02Having02satisfied02himself02that02
Raskolnikov02was02not02frightened02at02his02threat,02he02assumed02a02
mirthful02and02friendly02air.0202
"What02a02fellow!02I02purposely02refrained02from02referring02to02

Svidriga07lov02was02already02in02the02carriage.02Raskolnikov02
decided02that02his02suspicions02were02at02least02for02that02moment02
unjust.02Without02answering02a02word02he02turned02and02walked02
back02towards02the02Hay02Market.02If02he02had02only02turned02round02
on02his02way02he02might02have02seen02Svidriga07lov02get02out02not02a02
hundred02paces02off,02dismiss02the02cab02and02walk02along02the02
pavement.02But02he02had02turned02the02corner02and02could02see02
nothing.02Intense02disgust02drew02him02away02from02Svidriga07lov.0202
"To02think02that02I02could02for02one02instant02have02looked02for02
help02from02that02coarse02brute,02that02depraved02sensualist02and02
blackguard!"02he02cried.0202
Raskolnikov's02judgment02was02uttered02too02lightly02and02
hastily:02there02was02something02about02Svidriga07lov02which02
gave02him02a02certain02original,02even02a02mysterious02character.02
As02concerned02his02sister,02Raskolnikov02was02convinced02that02
Svidriga07lov02would02not02leave02her02in02peace.02But02it02was02too02
tiresome02and02unbearable02to02go02on02thinking02and02thinking02
about02this.0202
When02he02was02alone,02he02had02not02gone02twenty02paces02
before02he02sank,02as02usual,02into02deep02thought.02On02the02bridge02
he02stood02by02the02railing02and02began02gazing02at02the02water.02And02
his02sister02was02standing02close02by02him.0202
He02met02her02at02the02entrance02to02the02bridge,02but02passed02by02
without02seeing02her.02Dounia02had02never02met02him02like02this02in02
the02street02before02and02was02struck02with02dismay.02She02stood02
still02and02did02not02know02whether02to02call02to02him02or02not.02
Suddenly02she02saw02Svidriga07lov02coming02quickly02from02the02
direction02of02the02Hay02Market.0202
He02seemed02to02be02approaching02cautiously.02He02did02not02go02
on02to02the02bridge,02but02stood02aside02on02the02pavement,02doing02
all02he02could02to02avoid02Raskolnikov's02seeing02him.02He02had02
observed02Dounia02for02some02time02and02had02been02making02
signs02to02her.02She02fancied02he02was02signalling02to02beg02her02not02to02
speak02to02her02brother,02but02to02come02to02him.0202
That02was02what02Dounia02did.02She02stole02by02her02brother02and02
went02up02to02Svidriga07lov.0202
"Let02us02make02haste02away,"02Svidriga07lov02whispered02to02
her,02"I02don't02want02Rodion02Romanovitch02to02know02of02our02
meeting.02I02must02tell02you02I've02been02sitting02with02him02in02the02
restaurant02close02by,02where02he02looked02me02up02and02I02had02
great02difficulty02in02getting02rid02of02him.02He02has02somehow02
heard02of02my02letter02to02you02and02suspects02something.02It02
wasn't02you02who02told02him,02of02course,02but02if02not02you,02who02
then?"0202
"Well,02 we've02
the02 corner02 now,"02 Dounia02
interrupted,02"and02my02brother02won't02see02us.02I02have02to02tell02
turned02
you02that02I02am02going02no02further02with02you.02Speak02to02me02here.02

"In02the02first02place,02I02can't02say02it02in02the02street;02secondly,02

curious02secret02of02your02beloved02brother's02is02entirely02in02my02
keeping."0202
Dounia02stood02still,02hesitating,02and02looked02at02Svidriga07lov02
with02searching02eyes.0202
"What02are02you02afraid02of?"02he02observed02quietly.02"The02
town02is02not02the02country.02And02even02in02the02country02you02did02
me02more02harm02than02I02did02you."0202
"Have02you02prepared02Sofya02Semyonovna?"0202
"No,02I02have02not02said02a02word02to02her02and02am02not02quite02

speak02to02anyone02about02it02and02I02half02regret02having02spoken02to02

thing02like02this.02I02live02there02in02that02house,02we02are02coming02to02
it.02That's02the02porter02of02our02house―he02knows02me02very02well;02
you02see,02he's02bowing;02he02sees02I'm02coming02with02a02lady02and02
no02doubt02he02has02noticed02your02face02already02and02you02will02be02
glad02of02that02if02you02are02afraid02of02me02and02suspicious.02Excuse02
my02putting02things02so02coarsely.02I02haven't02a02flat02to02myself;02
Sofya02Semyonovna's02room02is02next02to02mine―she02lodges02in02
the02next02flat.02The02whole02floor02is02let02out02in02lodgings.02Why02are02
you02frightened02like02a02child?02Am02I02really02so02terrible?"0202
Svidriga07lov's02lips02were02twisted02in02a02condescending02
smile;02but02he02was02in02no02smiling02mood.02His02heart02was02
throbbing02and02he02could02scarcely02breathe.02He02spoke02rather02
loud02to02cover02his02growing02excitement.02But02Dounia02did02not02
notice02this02peculiar02excitement,02she02was02so02irritated02by02his02
remark02that02she02was02frightened02of02him02like02a02child02and02that02
he02was02so02terrible02to02her.0202
"Though02I02know02that02you02are02not02a02man...02of02honour,02I02
am02not02in02the02least02afraid02of02you.02Lead02the02way,"02she02said02
with02apparent02composure,02but02her02face02was02very02pale.0202
Svidriga07lov02stopped02at02Sonia's02room.0202
"Allow02me02to02inquire02whether02she02is02at02home....02She02is02
not.02How02unfortunate!02But02I02know02she02may02come02quite02
soon.02If02she's02gone02out,02it02can02only02be02to02see02a02lady02about02
the02orphans.02Their02mother02is02dead....02I've02been02meddling02
and02making02arrangements02for02them.02If02Sofya02Semyonovna02
does02not02come02back02in02ten02minutes,02I02will02send02her02to02you,02
to\day02if02you02like.02This02is02my02flat.02These02are02my02two02rooms.02

look02this02way.02I02will02show02you02my02chief02piece02of02evidence:02
this02door02from02my02bedroom02leads02into02two02perfectly02empty02
rooms,02which02are02to02let.02Here02they02are...02You02must02look02into02
them02with02some02attention."0202
Svidriga07lov02occupied02two02fairly02large02furnished02rooms.02
Dounia02was02looking02about02her02mistrustfully,02but02saw02
nothing02special02in02the02furniture02or02position02of02the02rooms.02
Yet02there02was02something02to02observe,02for02instance,02that02
Svidriga07lov's02flat02was02exactly02between02two02sets02of02almost02
uninhabited02apartments.02His02rooms02were02not02entered02
directly02from02the02passage,02but02through02the02landlady's02two02
almost02empty02rooms.02Unlocking02a02door02leading02out02of02his02
bedroom,02Svidriga07lov02showed02Dounia02the02two02empty02
rooms02that02were02to02let.02Dounia02stopped02in02the02doorway,02
not02knowing02what02she02was02called02to02look02upon,02but02
Svidriga07lov02hastened02to02explain.0202
"Look02here,02at02this02second02large02room.02Notice02that02door,02
it's02locked.02By02the02door02stands02a02chair,02the02only02one02in02the02
two02rooms.02I02brought02it02from02my02rooms02so02as02to02listen02
more02conveniently.02Just02the02other02side02of02the02door02is02Sofya02
Semyonovna's02table;02she02sat02there02talking02to02Rodion02
Romanovitch.02And02I02sat02here02listening02on02two02successive02
evenings,02for02two02hours02each02time―and02of02course02I02was02
able02to02learn02something,02what02do02you02think?"0202
"You02listened?"0202
"Yes,02I02did.02Now02come02back02to02my02room;02we02can't02sit02
down02here."0202
He02brought02Avdotya02Romanovna02back02into02his02sitting\
room02and02offered02her02a02chair.02He02sat02down02at02the02opposite02
side02of02the02table,02at02least02seven02feet02from02her,02but02probably02
there02was02the02same02glow02in02his02eyes02which02had02once02
frightened02Dounia02so02much.02She02shuddered02and02once02more02
looked02about02her02distrustfully.02It02was02an02involuntary02
gesture;02she02evidently02did02not02wish02to02betray02her02
uneasiness.02But02the02secluded02position02of02Svidriga07lov's02
lodging02had02suddenly02struck02her.02She02wanted02to02ask02
whether02his02landlady02at02least02were02at02home,02but02pride02kept02
her02from02asking.02Moreover,02she02had02another02trouble02in02her02
heart02incomparably02greater02than02fear02for02herself.02She02was02
in02great02distress.0202
"Here02is02your02letter,"02she02said,02laying02it02on02the02table.02
"Can02it02be02true02what02you02write?02You02hint02at02a02crime02
committed,02you02say,02by02my02brother.02You02hint02at02it02too02
clearly;02you02daren't02deny02it02now.02I02must02tell02you02that02I'd02
heard02of02this02stupid02story02before02you02wrote02and02don't02

it.02Speak!02But02let02me02warn02you02that02I02don't02believe02you!02I02
don't02believe02you!"0202
Dounia02said02this,02speaking02hurriedly,02and02for02an02instant02
the02colour02rushed02to02her02face.0202
"If02you02didn't02believe02it,02how02could02you02risk02coming02
alone02to02my02rooms?02Why02have02you02come?02Simply02from02

"Don't02torment02me.02Speak,02speak!"0202
"There's02no02denying02that02you02are02a02brave02girl.02Upon02my02

"Surely02that's02not02the02only02thing02you02are02building02on?"0202
"No,02not02on02that,02but02on02his02own02words.02He02came02here02

"It02cannot02be,"02muttered02Dounia,02with02white02lips.02She02
gasped02for02breath.02"It02cannot02be.02There02was02not02the02

you02know02him,02and02you've02seen02him,02can02he02be02a02thief?"0202
She02seemed02to02be02imploring02Svidriga07lov;02she02had02
entirely02forgotten02her02fear.0202

to02the02door.0202
"Open02it!02Open02it!"02she02called,02shaking02the02door.02"Open02
it!02Is02there02no02one02there?"0202
Svidriga07lov02got02up02and02came02to02himself.02His02still02
trembling02lips02slowly02broke02into02an02angry02mocking02smile.0202
"There02is02no02one02at02home,"02he02said02quietly02and02
emphatically.02"The02landlady02has02gone02out,02and02it's02waste02of02

"I02have02lost02the02key02and02cannot02find02it."0202
"This02is02an02outrage,"02cried02Dounia,02turning02pale02as02
death.02She02rushed02to02the02furthest02corner,02where02she02made02
haste02to02barricade02herself02with02a02little02table.0202
She02did02not02scream,02but02she02fixed02her02eyes02on02her02
tormentor02and02watched02every02movement02he02made.0202
Svidriga07lov02remained02standing02at02the02other02end02of02the02
room02facing02her.02He02was02positively02composed,02at02least02in02
appearance,02but02his02face02was02pale02as02before.02The02mocking02
smile02did02not02leave02his02face.0202
"You02spoke02of02outrage02just02now,02Avdotya02Romanovna.02
In02that02case02you02may02be02sure02I've02taken02measures.02Sofya02

away―there02are02five02locked02rooms02between.02I02am02at02least02
twice02as02strong02as02you02are02and02I02have02nothing02to02fear,02

surely02would02not02be02willing02actually02to02betray02your02

So02that02even02if02you02do02sacrifice02your02brother,02you02could02
prove02nothing.02It02is02very02difficult02to02prove02an02assault,02
Avdotya02Romanovna."0202
"Scoundrel!"02whispered02Dounia02indignantly.0202
"As02you02like,02but02observe02I02was02only02speaking02by02way02of02
a02general02proposition.02It's02my02personal02conviction02that02you02
are02perfectly02right―violence02is02hateful.02I02only02spoke02to02
show02you02that02you02need02have02no02remorse02even02if...02you02

Svidriga07lov02sat02down02on02the02sofa02about02eight02steps02
from02Dounia.02She02had02not02the02slightest02doubt02now02of02his02
unbending02 determination.02 Besides,02 she02 knew02 him.02
Suddenly02she02pulled02out02of02her02pocket02a02revolver,02cocked02it02
and02laid02it02in02her02hand02on02the02table.02Svidriga07lov02jumped02
up.0202"Aha!02So02that's02it,02is02it?"02he02cried,02surprised02but02smiling02
maliciously.02"Well,02that02completely02alters02the02aspect02of02

"It's02not02your02revolver,02it02belonged02to02Marfa02Petrovna,02

"But02 your02 brother?02

Svidriga07lov,02still02standing02where02he02was.0202
"Inform,02if02you02want02to!02Don't02stir!02Don't02come02nearer!02
I'll02shoot!02You02poisoned02your02wife,02I02know;02you02are02a02
murderer02yourself!"02She02held02the02revolver02ready.0202
"Are02you02so02positive02I02poisoned02Marfa02Petrovna?"0202
"You02did!02You02hinted02it02yourself;02you02talked02to02me02of02
poison....02I02know02you02went02to02get02it...02you02had02it02in02

"Even02if02that02were02true,02it02would02have02been02for02your02
sake...02you02would02have02been02the02cause."0202
"You02are02lying!02I02hated02you02always,02always...."0202
"Oho,02Avdotya02Romanovna!02You02seem02to02have02forgotten02
how02you02softened02to02me02in02the02heat02of02propaganda.02I02saw02it02
in02your02eyes.02Do02you02remember02that02moonlight02night,02
when02the02nightingale02was02singing?"0202
"That's02a02lie,"02there02was02a02flash02of02fury02in02Dounia's02eyes,02
"that's02a02lie02and02a02libel!"0202
"A02lie?02Well,02if02you02like,02it's02a02lie.02I02made02it02up.02Women02
ought02not02to02be02reminded02of02such02things,"02he02smiled.02"I02
know02you02will02shoot,02you02pretty02wild02creature.02Well,02shoot02
away!"0202
Dounia02raised02the02revolver,02and02deadly02pale,02gazed02at02
him,02measuring02the02distance02and02awaiting02the02first02
movement02on02his02part.02Her02lower02lip02was02white02and02
quivering02and02her02big02black02eyes02flashed02like02fire.02He02had02
never02seen02her02so02handsome.02The02fire02glowing02in02her02eyes02
at02the02moment02she02raised02the02revolver02seemed02to02kindle02
him02and02there02was02a02pang02of02anguish02in02his02heart.02He02took02a02
step02forward02and02a02shot02rang02out.02The02bullet02grazed02his02
hair02and02flew02into02the02wall02behind.02He02stood02still02and02
laughed02softly.0202
"The02wasp02has02stung02me.02She02aimed02straight02at02my02
head.02What's02this?02Blood?"02he02pulled02out02his02handkerchief02
to02wipe02the02blood,02which02flowed02in02a02thin02stream02down02his02
right02temple.02The02bullet02seemed02to02have02just02grazed02the02
skin.0202Dounia02lowered02the02revolver02and02looked02at02Svidriga07lov02
not02so02much02in02terror02as02in02a02sort02of02wild02amazement.02She02
seemed02not02to02understand02what02she02was02doing02and02what02
was02going02on.0202
"Well,02 you02 missed!02 Fire02 again,02
I'll02 wait,"02 said02
Svidriga07lov02softly,02still02smiling,02but02gloomily.02"If02you02go02on02
like02that,02I02shall02have02time02to02seize02you02before02you02cock02
again."0202Dounia02started,02quickly02cocked02the02pistol02and02again02
raised02it.0202
"Let02me02be,"02she02cried02in02despair.02"I02swear02I'll02shoot02
again.02I...02I'll02kill02you."0202
"Well...02at02three02paces02you02can02hardly02help02it.02But02if02you02
don't...02then."02His02eyes02flashed02and02he02took02two02steps02
forward.02Dounia02shot02again:02it02missed02fire.0202
"You02haven't02loaded02it02properly.02Never02mind,02you02have02
another02charge02there.02Get02it02ready,02I'll02wait."0202
He02stood02facing02her,02two02paces02away,02waiting02and02
gazing02at02her02with02wild02determination,02with02feverishly02
passionate,02stubborn,02set02eyes.02Dounia02saw02that02he02would02
sooner02die02than02let02her02go.02"And...02now,02of02course02she02
would02kill02him,02at02two02paces!"02Suddenly02she02flung02away02the02
revolver.0202
"She's02dropped02it!"02said02Svidriga07lov02with02surprise,02and02
he02drew02a02deep02breath.02A02weight02seemed02to02have02rolled02
from02his02heart―perhaps02not02only02the02fear02of02death;02indeed02
he02may02scarcely02have02felt02it02at02that02moment.02It02was02the02
deliverance02from02another02feeling,02darker02and02more02bitter,02
which02he02could02not02himself02have02defined.0202
He02went02to02Dounia02and02gently02put02his02arm02round02her02
waist.02She02did02not02resist,02but,02trembling02like02a02leaf,02looked02
at02him02with02suppliant02eyes.02He02tried02to02say02something,02but02
his02lips02moved02without02being02able02to02utter02a02sound.0202
"Let02me02go,"02Dounia02implored.02Svidriga07lov02shuddered.02
Her02voice02now02was02quite02different.0202
"Then02you02don't02love02me?"02he02asked02softly.02Dounia02
shook02her02head.0202
"And...02and02you02can't?02Never?"02he02whispered02in02despair.0202
"Never!"0202
There02followed02a02moment02of02terrible,02dumb02struggle02in02
the02heart02of02Svidriga07lov.02He02looked02at02her02with02an02
indescribable02gaze.02Suddenly02he02withdrew02his02arm,02turned02
quickly02to02the02window02and02stood02facing02it.02Another02
moment02passed.0202
"Here's02the02key."0202
He02took02it02out02of02the02left02pocket02of02his02coat02and02laid02it02on02
the02table02behind02him,02without02turning02or02looking02at02
Dounia.0202
"Take02it!02Make02haste!"0202
He02looked02stubbornly02out02of02the02window.02Dounia02went02
up02to02the02table02to02take02the02key.0202
"Make02haste!02Make02haste!"02repeated02Svidriga07lov,02still02
without02turning02or02moving.02But02there02seemed02a02terrible02
significance02in02the02tone02of02that02"make02haste."0202
Dounia02understood02it,02snatched02up02the02key,02flew02to02the02
door,02unlocked02it02quickly02and02rushed02out02of02the02room.02A02
minute02later,02beside02herself,02she02ran02out02on02to02the02canal02
bank02in02the02direction02of02X.02Bridge.0202
Svidriga07lov02remained02three02minutes02standing02at02the02
window.02At02last02he02slowly02turned,02looked02about02him02and02
passed02his02hand02over02his02forehead.02A02strange02smile02
contorted02his02face,02a02pitiful,02sad,02weak02smile,02a02smile02of02
despair.02The02blood,02which02was02already02getting02dry,02
smeared02his02hand.02He02looked02angrily02at02it,02then02wetted02a02
towel02and02washed02his02temple.02The02revolver02which02Dounia02
had02flung02away02lay02near02the02door02and02suddenly02caught02his02
eye.02He02picked02it02up02and02examined02it.02It02was02a02little02pocket02
three\barrel02revolver02of02old\fashioned02construction.02There02
were02still02two02charges02and02one02capsule02left02in02it.02It02could02be02
fired02again.02He02thought02a02little,02put02the02revolver02in02his02
pocket,02took02his02hat02and02went02out.0202
02

CHAPTER02VI0202
He02spent02that02evening02till02ten02o'clock02going02from02one02
low02haunt02to02another.02Katia02too02turned02up02and02sang02
another02gutter02song,02how02a02certain02"villain02and02tyrant,"0202
"began02kissing02Katia."0202
Svidriga07lov02treated02Katia02and02the02organ\grinder02and02
some02singers02and02the02waiters02and02two02little02clerks.02He02was02
particularly02drawn02to02these02clerks02by02the02fact02that02they02
both02had02crooked02noses,02one02bent02to02the02left02and02the02other02
to02the02right.02They02took02him02finally02to02a02pleasure02garden,02
where02he02paid02for02their02entrance.02There02was02one02lanky02
three\year\old02pine\tree02and02three02bushes02in02the02garden,02
besides02a02"Vauxhall,"02which02was02in02reality02a02drinking\bar02
where02tea02too02was02served,02and02there02were02a02few02green02
tables02and02chairs02standing02round02it.02A02chorus02of02wretched02
singers02and02a02drunken02but02exceedingly02depressed02German02
clown02from02Munich02with02a02red02nose02entertained02the02public.02
The02clerks02quarrelled02with02some02other02clerks02and02a02fight02
seemed02imminent.02Svidriga07lov02was02chosen02to02decide02the02
dispute.02He02listened02to02them02for02a02quarter02of02an02hour,02but02
they02shouted02so02loud02that02there02was02no02possibility02of02
understanding02them.02The02only02fact02that02seemed02certain02
was02that02one02of02them02had02stolen02something02and02had02even02
succeeded02in02selling02it02on02the02spot02to02a02Jew,02but02would02not02
share02the02spoil02with02his02companion.02Finally02it02appeared02
that02the02stolen02object02was02a02teaspoon02belonging02to02the02
Vauxhall.02It02was02missed02and02the02affair02began02to02seem02
troublesome.02Svidriga07lov02paid02for02the02spoon,02got02up,02and02
walked02out02of02the02garden.02It02was02about02six02o'clock.02He02had02
not02drunk02a02drop02of02wine02all02this02time02and02had02ordered02tea02
more02for02the02sake02of02appearances02than02anything.0202
It02was02a02dark02and02stifling02evening.02Threatening02storm\
clouds02came02over02the02sky02about02ten02o'clock.02There02was02a02
clap02of02thunder,02and02the02rain02came02down02like02a02waterfall.02
The02water02fell02not02in02drops,02but02beat02on02the02earth02in02
streams.02There02were02flashes02of02lightning02every02minute02and02
each02flash02lasted02while02one02could02count02five.0202
Drenched02to02the02skin,02he02went02home,02locked02himself02in,02
opened02the02bureau,02took02out02all02his02money02and02tore02up02two02
or02three02papers.02Then,02putting02the02money02in02his02pocket,02he02
was02about02to02change02his02clothes,02but,02looking02out02of02the02
window02and02listening02to02the02thunder02and02the02rain,02he02gave02
up02the02idea,02took02up02his02hat02and02went02out02of02the02room02
without02locking02the02door.02He02went02straight02to02Sonia.02She02
was02at02home.0202
She02was02not02alone:02the02four02Kapernaumov02children02
were02with02her.02She02was02giving02them02tea.02She02received02
Svidriga07lov02in02respectful02silence,02looking02wonderingly02at02
his02soaking02clothes.02The02children02all02ran02away02at02once02in02
indescribable02terror.0202
Svidriga07lov02sat02down02at02the02table02and02asked02Sonia02to02sit02
beside02him.02She02timidly02prepared02to02listen.0202
"I02may02be02going02to02America,02Sofya02Semyonovna,"02said02
Svidriga07lov,02"and02as02I02am02probably02seeing02you02for02the02last02

He02went02out,02leaving02Sonia02in02a02state02of02wondering02

It02appeared02afterwards02that02on02the02same02evening,02at02
twenty02past02eleven,02he02made02another02very02eccentric02and02
unexpected02visit.02The02rain02still02persisted.02Drenched02to02the02

the02tender02and02sensible02mother,02who02as02usual02began02the02
conversation02with02various02irrelevant02questions.02She02never02
asked02a02direct02question,02but02began02by02smiling02and02rubbing02
her02hands02and02then,02if02she02were02obliged02to02ascertain02
something―for02instance,02when02Svidriga07lov02would02like02to02
have02the02wedding―she02would02begin02by02interested02and02
almost02eager02questions02about02Paris02and02the02court02life02
there,02and02only02by02degrees02brought02the02conversation02
round02to02Third02Street.02On02other02occasions02this02had02of02
course02been02very02impressive,02but02this02time02Arkady02
Ivanovitch02seemed02particularly02impatient,02and02insisted02on02
seeing02his02betrothed02at02once,02though02he02had02been02
informed,02to02begin02with,02that02she02had02already02gone02to02bed.02
The02girl02of02course02appeared.0202
Svidriga07lov02informed02her02at02once02that02he02was02obliged02
by02very02important02affairs02to02leave02Petersburg02for02a02time,02
and02therefore02brought02her02fifteen02thousand02roubles02and02
begged02her02accept02them02as02a02present02from02him,02as02he02had02
long02been02intending02to02make02her02this02trifling02present02
before02their02wedding.02The02logical02connection02of02the02
present02with02his02immediate02departure02and02the02absolute02
necessity02of02visiting02them02for02that02purpose02in02pouring02rain02
at02midnight02was02not02made02clear.02But02it02all02went02off02very02
well;02even02the02inevitable02ejaculations02of02wonder02and02
regret,02the02inevitable02questions02were02extraordinarily02few02
and02restrained.02On02the02other02hand,02the02gratitude02expressed02
was02most02glowing02and02was02reinforced02by02tears02from02the02
most02sensible02of02mothers.02Svidriga07lov02got02up,02laughed,02
kissed02his02betrothed,02patted02her02cheek,02declared02he02would02
soon02come02back,02and02noticing02in02her02eyes,02together02with02
childish02curiosity,02a02sort02of02earnest02dumb02inquiry,02reflected02
and02kissed02her02again,02though02he02felt02sincere02anger02
inwardly02at02the02thought02that02his02present02would02be02
immediately02locked02up02in02the02keeping02of02the02most02sensible02
of02mothers.02He02went02away,02leaving02them02all02in02a02state02of02
extraordinary02 excitement,02 but02
tender02 mamma,02
speaking02quietly02in02a02half02whisper,02settled02some02of02the02
most02
that02
their02 doubts,02 concluding02
Svidriga07lov02was02a02great02man,02a02man02of02great02affairs02and02
important02 of02
the02
connections02and02of02great02wealth―there02was02no02knowing02
what02he02had02in02his02mind.02He02would02start02off02on02a02journey02
and02give02away02money02just02as02the02fancy02took02him,02so02that02
there02was02nothing02surprising02about02it.02Of02course02it02was02
strange02that02he02was02wet02through,02but02Englishmen,02for02
instance,02are02even02more02eccentric,02and02all02these02people02of02
high02society02didn't02think02of02what02was02said02of02them02and02
didn't02stand02on02ceremony.02Possibly,02indeed,02he02came02like02
that02on02purpose02to02show02that02he02was02not02afraid02of02anyone.02
Above02all,02not02a02word02should02be02said02about02it,02for02God02
knows02what02might02come02of02it,02and02the02money02must02be02
locked02up,02and02it02was02most02fortunate02that02Fedosya,02the02
cook,02had02not02left02the02kitchen.02And02above02all02not02a02word02
must02be02said02to02that02old02cat,02Madame02Resslich,02and02so02on02
and02so02on.02They02sat02up02whispering02till02two02o'clock,02but02the02
girl02went02to02bed02much02earlier,02amazed02and02rather02
sorrowful.0202
Svidriga07lov02meanwhile,02exactly02at02midnight,02crossed02
the02bridge02on02the02way02back02to02the02mainland.02The02rain02had02
ceased02and02there02was02a02roaring02wind.02He02began02shivering,02
and02for02one02moment02he02gazed02at02the02black02waters02of02the02
Little02Neva02with02a02look02of02special02interest,02even02inquiry.02
But02he02soon02felt02it02very02cold,02standing02by02the02water;02he02
turned02and02went02towards02Y.02Prospect.02He02walked02along02
that02endless02street02for02a02long02time,02almost02half02an02hour,02
more02than02once02stumbling02in02the02dark02on02the02wooden02
pavement,02but02continually02looking02for02something02on02the02
right02side02of02the02street.02He02had02noticed02passing02through02
this02street02lately02that02there02was02a02hotel02somewhere02
towards02the02end,02built02of02wood,02but02fairly02large,02and02its02
name02he02remembered02was02something02like02Adrianople.02He02
was02not02mistaken:02the02hotel02was02so02conspicuous02in02that02
God\forsaken02place02that02he02could02not02fail02to02see02it02even02in02
the02dark.02It02was02a02long,02blackened02wooden02building,02and02in02
spite02of02the02late02hour02there02were02lights02in02the02windows02and02
signs02of02life02within.02He02went02in02and02asked02a02ragged02fellow02
who02met02him02in02the02corridor02for02a02room.02The02latter,02
scanning02Svidriga07lov,02pulled02himself02together02and02led02him02
at02once02to02a02close02and02tiny02room02in02the02distance,02at02the02end02
of02the02corridor,02under02the02stairs.02There02was02no02other,02all02
were02occupied.02The02ragged02fellow02looked02inquiringly.0202
"Is02there02tea?"02asked02Svidriga07lov.0202
"Yes,02sir."0202
"What02else02is02there?"0202
"Veal,02vodka,02savouries."0202
"Bring02me02tea02and02veal."0202
"And02you02want02nothing02else?"02he02asked02with02apparent02
surprise.0202
"Nothing,02nothing."0202
The02ragged02man02went02away,02completely02disillusioned.0202
"It02must02be02a02nice02place,"02thought02Svidriga07lov.02"How02
was02it02I02didn't02know02it?02I02expect02I02look02as02if02I02came02from02a02
café02chantant02and02have02had02some02adventure02on02the02way.02It02
would02be02interesting02to02know02who02stay02here?"0202
He02lighted02the02candle02and02looked02at02the02room02more02
carefully.02It02was02a02room02so02low\pitched02that02Svidriga07lov02
could02only02just02stand02up02in02it;02it02had02one02window;02the02bed,02
which02was02very02dirty,02and02the02plain\stained02chair02and02table02
almost02filled02it02up.02The02walls02looked02as02though02they02were02
made02of02planks,02covered02with02shabby02paper,02so02torn02and02
dusty02that02the02pattern02was02indistinguishable,02though02the02
general02colour―yellow―could02still02be02made02out.02One02of02
the02walls02was02cut02short02by02the02sloping02ceiling,02though02the02
room02was02not02an02attic02but02just02under02the02stairs.0202
Svidriga07lov02set02down02the02candle,02sat02down02on02the02bed02
and02sank02into02thought.02But02a02strange02persistent02murmur02
which02sometimes02rose02to02a02shout02in02the02next02room02
attracted02his02attention.02The02murmur02had02not02ceased02from02
the02moment02he02entered02the02room.02He02listened:02someone02
was02upbraiding02and02almost02tearfully02scolding,02but02he02heard02
only02one02voice.0202
Svidriga07lov02got02up,02shaded02the02light02with02his02hand02and02
at02once02he02saw02light02through02a02crack02in02the02wall;02he02went02
up02and02peeped02through.02The02room,02which02was02somewhat02
larger02than02his,02had02two02occupants.02One02of02them,02a02very02
curly\headed02man02with02a02red02inflamed02face,02was02standing02
in02the02pose02of02an02orator,02without02his02coat,02with02his02legs02
wide02apart02to02preserve02his02balance,02and02smiting02himself02on02
the02breast.02He02reproached02the02other02with02being02a02beggar,02
with02having02no02standing02whatever.02He02declared02that02he02
had02taken02the02other02out02of02the02gutter02and02he02could02turn02
him02out02when02he02liked,02and02that02only02the02finger02of02
Providence02sees02it02all.02The02object02of02his02reproaches02was02
sitting02in02a02chair,02and02had02the02air02of02a02man02who02wants02
dreadfully02to02sneeze,02but02can't.02He02sometimes02turned02
sheepish02and02befogged02eyes02on02the02speaker,02but02obviously02
had02not02the02slightest02idea02what02he02was02talking02about02and02
scarcely02heard02it.02A02candle02was02burning02down02on02the02table;02
there02were02wine\glasses,02a02nearly02empty02bottle02of02vodka,02
bread02and02cucumber,02and02glasses02with02the02dregs02of02stale02
tea.02After02gazing02attentively02at02this,02Svidriga07lov02turned02
away02indifferently02and02sat02down02on02the02bed.0202
The02ragged02attendant,02returning02with02the02tea,02could02not02
resist02asking02him02again02whether02he02didn't02want02anything02
more,02 and02 again02 receiving02 a02 negative02 reply,02 finally02
withdrew.02Svidriga07lov02made02haste02to02drink02a02glass02of02tea02
to02warm02himself,02but02could02not02eat02anything.02He02began02to02
feel02feverish.02He02took02off02his02coat02and,02wrapping02himself02in02
the02blanket,02lay02down02on02the02bed.02He02was02annoyed.02"It02
would02have02been02better02to02be02well02for02the02occasion,"02he02
thought02with02a02smile.02The02room02was02close,02the02candle02
burnt02dimly,02the02wind02was02roaring02outside,02he02heard02a02
mouse02scratching02in02the02corner02and02the02room02smelt02of02mice02
and02of02leather.02He02lay02in02a02sort02of02reverie:02one02thought02
followed02another.02He02felt02a02longing02to02fix02his02imagination02
on02something.02"It02must02be02a02garden02under02the02window,"02he02
thought.02"There's02a02sound02of02trees.02How02I02dislike02the02sound02
of02trees02on02a02stormy02night,02in02the02dark!02They02give02one02a02
horrid02feeling."02He02remembered02how02he02had02disliked02it02
when02he02passed02Petrovsky02Park02just02now.02This02reminded02
him02of02the02bridge02over02the02Little02Neva02and02he02felt02cold02
again02as02he02had02when02standing02there.02"I02never02have02liked02
water,"02he02thought,02"even02in02a02landscape,"02and02he02suddenly02
smiled02again02at02a02strange02idea:02"Surely02now02all02these02
questions02of02taste02and02comfort02ought02not02to02matter,02but02
I've02become02more02particular,02like02an02animal02that02picks02out02
a02special02place...02for02such02an02occasion.02I02ought02to02have02gone02
into02the02Petrovsky02Park!02I02suppose02it02seemed02dark,02cold,02
ha\ha!02As02though02I02were02seeking02pleasant02sensations!...02By02
the02way,02why02haven't02I02put02out02the02candle?"02he02blew02it02out.02
"They've02gone02to02bed02next02door,"02he02thought,02not02seeing02
the02light02at02the02crack.02"Well,02now,02Marfa02Petrovna,02now02is02
the02time02for02you02to02turn02up;02it's02dark,02and02the02very02time02and02
place02for02you.02But02now02you02won't02come!"0202
He02suddenly02recalled02how,02an02hour02before02carrying02out02
his02design02on02Dounia,02he02had02recommended02Raskolnikov02
to02trust02her02to02Razumihin's02keeping.02"I02suppose02I02really02did02
say02it,02as02Raskolnikov02guessed,02to02tease02myself.02But02what02a02
rogue02that02Raskolnikov02is!02He's02gone02through02a02good02deal.02
He02may02be02a02successful02rogue02in02time02when02he's02got02over02
his02nonsense.02But02now02he's02too02eager02for02life.02These02young02
men02are02contemptible02on02that02point.02But,02hang02the02fellow!02
Let02him02please02himself,02it's02nothing02to02do02with02me."0202
He02could02not02get02to02sleep.02By02degrees02Dounia's02image02
rose02before02him,02and02a02shudder02ran02over02him.02"No,02I02must02
give02up02all02that02now,"02he02thought,02rousing02himself.02"I02must02
think02of02something02else.02It's02queer02and02funny.02I02never02had02a02
great02hatred02for02anyone,02I02never02particularly02desired02to02
avenge02myself02even,02and02that's02a02bad02sign,02a02bad02sign,02a02bad02
sign.02I02never02liked02quarrelling02either,02and02never02lost02my02
temper―that's02a02bad02sign02too.02And02the02promises02I02made02
her02
just02 now,02 too―Damnation!02 But―who02 knows?―
perhaps02she02would02have02made02a02new02man02of02me02
somehow...."0202
He02ground02his02teeth02and02sank02into02silence02again.02Again02
Dounia's02image02rose02before02him,02just02as02she02was02when,02
after02shooting02the02first02time,02she02had02lowered02the02revolver02
in02terror02and02gazed02blankly02at02him,02so02that02he02might02have02
seized02her02twice02over02and02she02would02not02have02lifted02a02hand02
to02defend02herself02if02he02had02not02reminded02her.02He02recalled02
how02at02that02instant02he02felt02almost02sorry02for02her,02how02he02
had02felt02a02pang02at02his02heart...0202
"A07e!02Damnation,02these02thoughts02again!02I02must02put02it02
away!"0202He02was02dozing02off;02the02feverish02shiver02had02ceased,02when02
suddenly02something02seemed02to02run02over02his02arm02and02leg02
under02the02bedclothes.02He02started.02"Ugh!02hang02it!02I02believe02
it's02a02mouse,"02he02thought,02"that's02the02veal02I02left02on02the02
table."02He02felt02fearfully02disinclined02to02pull02off02the02blanket,02
get02up,02get02cold,02but02all02at02once02something02unpleasant02ran02
over02his02leg02again.02He02pulled02off02the02blanket02and02lighted02the02
candle.02Shaking02with02feverish02chill02he02bent02down02to02
examine02the02bed:02there02was02nothing.02He02shook02the02blanket02
and02suddenly02a02mouse02jumped02out02on02the02sheet.02He02tried02to02
catch02it,02but02the02mouse02ran02to02and02fro02in02zigzags02without02
leaving02the02bed,02slipped02between02his02fingers,02ran02over02his02
hand02and02suddenly02darted02under02the02pillow.02He02threw02
down02the02pillow,02but02in02one02instant02felt02something02leap02on02
his02chest02and02dart02over02his02body02and02down02his02back02under02
his02shirt.02He02trembled02nervously02and02woke02up.0202
The02room02was02dark.02He02was02lying02on02the02bed02and02
wrapped02up02in02the02blanket02as02before.02The02wind02was02
howling02under02the02window.02"How02disgusting,"02he02thought02
with02annoyance.0202
He02got02up02and02sat02on02the02edge02of02the02bedstead02with02his02
back02to02the02window.02"It's02better02not02to02sleep02at02all,"02he02
decided.02There02was02a02cold02damp02draught02from02the02window,02
however;02without02getting02up02he02drew02the02blanket02over02him02
and02wrapped02himself02in02it.02He02was02not02thinking02of02anything02
and02did02not02want02to02think.02But02one02image02rose02after02
another,02incoherent02scraps02of02thought02without02beginning02
or02end02passed02through02his02mind.02He02sank02into02drowsiness.02
Perhaps02the02cold,02or02the02dampness,02or02the02dark,02or02the02
wind02that02howled02under02the02window02and02tossed02the02trees02
roused02a02sort02of02persistent02craving02for02the02fantastic.02He02
kept02dwelling02on02images02of02flowers,02he02fancied02a02charming02
flower02garden,02a02bright,02warm,02almost02hot02day,02a02holiday―
Trinity02day.02A02fine,02sumptuous02country02cottage02in02the02

climbers,02was02surrounded02with02beds02of02roses.02A02light,02cool02
staircase,02carpeted02with02rich02rugs,02was02decorated02with02rare02
plants02in02china02pots.02He02noticed02particularly02in02the02
windows02nosegays02of02tender,02white,02heavily02fragrant02
narcissus02bending02over02their02bright,02green,02thick02long02
stalks.02He02was02reluctant02to02move02away02from02them,02but02he02
went02up02the02stairs02and02came02into02a02large,02high02drawing\
room02and02again02everywhere―at02the02windows,02the02doors02
on02to02the02balcony,02and02on02the02balcony02itself―were02flowers.02
The02floors02were02strewn02with02freshly\cut02fragrant02hay,02the02
windows02were02open,02a02fresh,02cool,02light02air02came02into02the02
room.02The02birds02were02chirruping02under02the02window,02and02
in02the02middle02of02the02room,02on02a02table02covered02with02a02white02
satin02shroud,02stood02a02coffin.02The02coffin02was02covered02with02
white02silk02and02edged02with02a02thick02white02frill;02wreaths02of02
flowers02surrounded02it02on02all02sides.02Among02the02flowers02lay02a02
girl02in02a02white02muslin02dress,02with02her02arms02crossed02and02
pressed02on02her02bosom,02as02though02carved02out02of02marble.02But02
her02loose02fair02hair02was02wet;02there02was02a02wreath02of02roses02on02
her02head.02The02stern02and02already02rigid02profile02of02her02face02
looked02as02though02chiselled02of02marble02too,02and02the02smile02on02
her02pale02lips02was02full02of02an02immense02unchildish02misery02and02
sorrowful02appeal.02Svidriga07lov02knew02that02girl;02there02was02no02
holy02image,02no02burning02candle02beside02the02coffin;02no02sound02
of02prayers:02the02girl02had02drowned02herself.02She02was02only02
fourteen,02 but02 her02 heart02 was02 broken.02 And02 she02 had02
destroyed02herself,02crushed02by02an02insult02that02had02appalled02
and02amazed02that02childish02soul,02had02smirched02that02angel02
purity02with02unmerited02disgrace02and02torn02from02her02a02last02
scream02of02despair,02unheeded02and02brutally02disregarded,02on02
a02dark02night02in02the02cold02and02wet02while02the02wind02howled....0202
Svidriga07lov02came02to02himself,02got02up02from02the02bed02and02
went02to02the02window.02He02felt02for02the02latch02and02opened02it.02
The02wind02lashed02furiously02into02the02little02room02and02stung02
his02face02and02his02chest,02only02covered02with02his02shirt,02as02
though02with02frost.02Under02the02window02there02must02have02
been02something02like02a02garden,02and02apparently02a02pleasure02
garden.02There,02too,02probably02there02were02tea\tables02and02
singing02in02the02daytime.02Now02drops02of02rain02flew02in02at02the02
window02from02the02trees02and02bushes;02it02was02dark02as02in02a02
cellar,02so02that02he02could02only02just02make02out02some02dark02blurs02
of02objects.02Svidriga07lov,02bending02down02with02elbows02on02the02
window\sill,02gazed02for02five02minutes02into02the02darkness;02the02
boom02of02a02cannon,02followed02by02a02second02one,02resounded02in02
the02darkness02of02the02night.02"Ah,02the02signal!02The02river02is02
overflowing,"02he02thought.02"By02morning02it02will02be02swirling02
down02the02street02in02the02lower02parts,02flooding02the02basements02
and02cellars.02The02cellar02rats02will02swim02out,02and02men02will02
curse02in02the02rain02and02wind02as02they02drag02their02rubbish02to02
their02upper02storeys.02What02time02is02it02now?"02And02he02had02
hardly02thought02it02when,02somewhere02near,02a02clock02on02the02
wall,02ticking02away02hurriedly,02struck02three.0202
"Aha!02It02will02be02light02in02an02hour!02Why02wait?02I'll02go02out02at02
once02straight02to02the02park.02I'll02choose02a02great02bush02there02
drenched02with02rain,02so02that02as02soon02as02one's02shoulder02
touches02it,02millions02of02drops02drip02on02one's02head."0202
He02moved02away02from02the02window,02shut02it,02lighted02the02
candle,02put02on02his02waistcoat,02his02overcoat02and02his02hat02and02
went02out,02carrying02the02candle,02into02the02passage02to02look02for02
the02ragged02attendant02who02would02be02asleep02somewhere02in02
the02midst02of02candle\ends02and02all02sorts02of02rubbish,02to02pay02
him02for02the02room02and02leave02the02hotel.02"It's02the02best02minute;02
I02couldn't02choose02a02better."0202
He02walked02for02some02time02through02a02long02narrow02
corridor02without02finding02anyone02and02was02just02going02to02call02
out,02when02suddenly02in02a02dark02corner02between02an02old02
cupboard02and02the02door02he02caught02sight02of02a02strange02object02
which02seemed02to02be02alive.02He02bent02down02with02the02candle02
and02saw02a02little02girl,02not02more02than02five02years02old,02shivering02
and02crying,02with02her02clothes02as02wet02as02a02soaking02house\
flannel.02She02did02not02seem02afraid02of02Svidriga07lov,02but02looked02
at02him02with02blank02amazement02out02of02her02big02black02eyes.02
Now02and02then02she02sobbed02as02children02do02when02they02have02
been02crying02a02long02time,02but02are02beginning02to02be02
comforted.02The02child's02face02was02pale02and02tired,02she02was02
numb02with02cold.02"How02can02she02have02come02here?02She02must02
have02hidden02here02and02not02slept02all02night."02He02began02
questioning02her.02The02child02suddenly02becoming02animated,02
chattered02away02in02her02baby02language,02something02about02
"mammy"02and02that02"mammy02would02beat02her,"02and02about02
some02cup02that02she02had02"bwoken."02The02child02chattered02on02
without02stopping.02He02could02only02guess02from02what02she02said02
that02she02was02a02neglected02child,02whose02mother,02probably02a02
drunken02cook,02in02the02service02of02the02hotel,02whipped02and02
frightened02her;02that02the02child02had02broken02a02cup02of02her02
mother's02and02was02so02frightened02that02she02had02run02away02the02
evening02before,02had02hidden02for02a02long02while02somewhere02
outside02in02the02rain,02at02last02had02made02her02way02in02here,02
hidden02behind02the02cupboard02and02spent02the02night02there,02
crying02and02trembling02from02the02damp,02the02darkness02and02the02
fear02that02she02would02be02badly02beaten02for02it.02He02took02her02in02
his02arms,02went02back02to02his02room,02sat02her02on02the02bed,02and02
began02undressing02her.02The02torn02shoes02which02she02had02on02
her02stockingless02feet02were02as02wet02as02if02they02had02been02
standing02in02a02puddle02all02night.02When02he02had02undressed02her,02
he02put02her02on02the02bed,02covered02her02up02and02wrapped02her02in02
the02blanket02from02her02head02downwards.02She02fell02asleep02at02
once.02Then02he02sank02into02dreary02musing02again.0202
"What02folly02to02trouble02myself,"02he02decided02suddenly02
with02an02oppressive02feeling02of02annoyance.02"What02idiocy!"02In02
vexation02he02took02up02the02candle02to02go02and02look02for02the02
ragged02attendant02again02and02make02haste02to02go02away.02"Damn02
the02child!"02he02thought02as02he02opened02the02door,02but02he02
turned02again02to02see02whether02the02child02was02asleep.02He02
raised02the02blanket02carefully.02The02child02was02sleeping02
soundly,02she02had02got02warm02under02the02blanket,02and02her02pale02
cheeks02were02flushed.02But02strange02to02say02that02flush02seemed02
brighter02and02coarser02than02the02rosy02cheeks02of02childhood.02
"It's02a02flush02of02fever,"02thought02Svidriga07lov.02It02was02like02the02
flush02from02drinking,02as02though02she02had02been02given02a02full02
glass02to02drink.02Her02crimson02lips02were02hot02and02glowing;02but02
what02was02this?02He02suddenly02fancied02that02her02long02black02
eyelashes02were02quivering,02as02though02the02lids02were02opening02
and02a02sly02crafty02eye02peeped02out02with02an02unchildlike02wink,02
as02though02the02little02girl02were02not02asleep,02but02pretending.02
Yes,02it02was02so.02Her02lips02parted02in02a02smile.02The02corners02of02her02
mouth02quivered,02as02though02she02were02trying02to02control02
them.02But02now02she02quite02gave02up02all02effort,02now02it02was02a02
grin,02a02broad02grin;02there02was02something02shameless,02
provocative02in02that02quite02unchildish02face;02it02was02depravity,02
it02was02the02face02of02a02harlot,02the02shameless02face02of02a02French02
harlot.02Now02both02eyes02opened02wide;02they02turned02a02
glowing,02shameless02glance02upon02him;02they02laughed,02invited02
him....02 There02 was02 something02
infinitely02 hideous02 and02
shocking02in02that02laugh,02in02those02eyes,02in02such02nastiness02in02
the02face02of02a02child.02"What,02at02five02years02old?"02Svidriga07lov02
muttered02in02genuine02horror.02"What02does02it02mean?"02And02
now02she02turned02to02him,02her02little02face02all02aglow,02holding02out02
her02arms....02"Accursed02child!"02Svidriga07lov02cried,02raising02his02
hand02to02strike02her,02but02at02that02moment02he02woke02up.0202
He02was02in02the02same02bed,02still02wrapped02in02the02blanket.02
The02candle02had02not02been02lighted,02and02daylight02was02
streaming02in02at02the02windows.0202
"I've02had02nightmare02all02night!"02He02got02up02angrily,02feeling02
utterly02shattered;02his02bones02ached.02There02was02a02thick02mist02
outside02and02he02could02see02nothing.02It02was02nearly02five.02He02
had02overslept02himself!02He02got02up,02put02on02his02still02damp02
jacket02and02overcoat.02Feeling02the02revolver02in02his02pocket,02he02
took02it02out02and02then02he02sat02down,02took02a02notebook02out02of02
his02pocket02and02in02the02most02conspicuous02place02on02the02title02
page02wrote02a02few02lines02in02large02letters.02Reading02them02over,02
he02sank02into02thought02with02his02elbows02on02the02table.02The02
revolver02and02the02notebook02lay02beside02him.02Some02flies02woke02
up02and02settled02on02the02untouched02veal,02which02was02still02on02
the02table.02He02stared02at02them02and02at02last02with02his02free02right02
hand02began02trying02to02catch02one.02He02tried02till02he02was02tired,02
but02could02not02catch02it.02At02last,02realising02that02he02was02
engaged02in02this02interesting02pursuit,02he02started,02got02up02and02
walked02resolutely02out02of02the02room.02A02minute02later02he02was02
in02the02street.0202
A02thick02milky02mist02hung02over02the02town.02Svidriga07lov02
walked02 along02 the02 slippery02 dirty02 wooden02 pavement02
towards02the02Little02Neva.02He02was02picturing02the02waters02of02the02
Little02Neva02swollen02in02the02night,02Petrovsky02Island,02the02wet02
paths,02the02wet02grass,02the02wet02trees02and02bushes02and02at02last02
the02bush....02He02began02ill\humouredly02staring02at02the02houses,02
trying02to02think02of02something02else.02There02was02not02a02cabman02
or02a02passer\by02in02the02street.02The02bright02yellow,02wooden,02
little02houses02looked02dirty02and02dejected02with02their02closed02
shutters.02The02cold02and02damp02penetrated02his02whole02body02
and02he02began02to02shiver.02From02time02to02time02he02came02across02
shop02signs02and02read02each02carefully.02At02last02he02reached02the02
end02of02the02wooden02pavement02and02came02to02a02big02stone02
house.02A02dirty,02shivering02dog02crossed02his02path02with02its02tail02
between02its02legs.02A02man02in02a02greatcoat02lay02face02downwards;02
dead02drunk,02across02the02pavement.02He02looked02at02him02and02
went02on.02A02high02tower02stood02up02on02the02left.02"Bah!"02he02
shouted,02"here02is02a02place.02Why02should02it02be02Petrovsky?02It02
will02be02in02the02presence02of02an02official02witness02anyway...."0202
He02almost02smiled02at02this02new02thought02and02turned02into02
the02street02where02there02was02the02big02house02with02the02tower.02
At02the02great02closed02gates02of02the02house,02a02little02man02stood02
with02his02shoulder02leaning02against02them,02wrapped02in02a02grey02
soldier's02coat,02with02a02copper02Achilles02helmet02on02his02head.02
He02cast02a02drowsy02and02indifferent02glance02at02Svidriga07lov.02His02
face02wore02that02perpetual02look02of02peevish02dejection,02which02
is02so02sourly02printed02on02all02faces02of02Jewish02race02without02
exception.02They02both,02Svidriga07lov02and02Achilles,02stared02at02
each02other02for02a02few02minutes02without02speaking.02At02last02it02
struck02Achilles02as02irregular02for02a02man02not02drunk02to02be02
standing02three02steps02from02him,02staring02and02not02saying02a02
word.0202
"What02do02you02want02here?"02he02said,02without02moving02or02
changing02his02position.0202
"Nothing,02
answered02
good02 morning,"02
brother,02
Svidriga07lov.0202
"This02isn't02the02place."0202
"I02am02going02to02foreign02parts,02brother."0202
"To02foreign02parts?"0202
"To02America."0202
"America."0202
Svidriga07lov02took02out02the02revolver02and02cocked02it.02
Achilles02raised02his02eyebrows.0202
"I02say,02this02is02not02the02place02for02such02jokes!"0202
"Why02shouldn't02it02be02the02place?"0202
"Because02it02isn't."0202
"Well,02brother,02I02don't02mind02that.02It's02a02good02place.02
When02you02are02asked,02you02just02say02he02was02going,02he02said,02to02
America."0202
He02put02the02revolver02to02his02right02temple.0202
"You02can't02do02it02here,02it's02not02the02place,"02cried02Achilles,02
rousing02himself,02his02eyes02growing02bigger02and02bigger.0202
Svidriga07lov02pulled02the02trigger.0202

CHAPTER02VII0202
The02same02day,02about02seven02o'clock02in02the02evening,02
Raskolnikov02was02on02his02way02to02his02mother's02and02sister's02
lodging―the02
in02 Bakaleyev's02 house02 which02
lodging02
Razumihin02had02found02for02them.02The02stairs02went02up02from02
the02street.02Raskolnikov02walked02with02lagging02steps,02as02
though02still02hesitating02whether02to02go02or02not.02But02nothing02
would02have02turned02him02back:02his02decision02was02taken.0202
"Besides,02it02doesn't02matter,02they02still02know02nothing,"02he02
thought,02"and02they02are02used02to02thinking02of02me02as02
eccentric."0202
He02was02appallingly02dressed:02his02clothes02torn02and02dirty,02
soaked02with02a02night's02rain.02His02face02was02almost02distorted02
from02fatigue,02exposure,02the02inward02conflict02that02had02lasted02
for02twenty\four02hours.02He02had02spent02all02the02previous02night02
alone,02God02knows02where.02But02anyway02he02had02reached02a02
decision.0202
He02knocked02at02the02door02which02was02opened02by02his02
mother.02Dounia02was02not02at02home.02Even02the02servant02
happened02to02be02out.02At02first02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02was02
speechless02with02joy02and02surprise;02then02she02took02him02by02the02
hand02and02drew02him02into02the02room.0202
"Here02you02are!"02she02began,02faltering02with02joy.02"Don't02be02
angry02with02me,02Rodya,02for02welcoming02you02so02foolishly02with02

"Very02far."0202
"What02is02awaiting02you02there?02Some02post02or02career02for02

"What02God02sends...02only02pray02for02me."02Raskolnikov02went02
to02the02door,02but02she02clutched02him02and02gazed02despairingly02
into02his02eyes.02Her02face02worked02with02terror.0202
"Enough,02mother,"02said02Raskolnikov,02deeply02regretting02
that02he02had02come.0202
"Not02for02ever,02it's02not02yet02for02ever?02You'll02come,02you'll02
come02to\morrow?"0202
"I02will,02I02will,02good\bye."02He02tore02himself02away02at02last.0202
It02was02a02warm,02fresh,02bright02evening;02it02had02cleared02up02
in02the02morning.02Raskolnikov02went02to02his02lodgings;02he02made02
haste.02He02wanted02to02finish02all02before02sunset.02He02did02not02
want02to02meet02anyone02till02then.02Going02up02the02stairs02he02
noticed02that02Nastasya02rushed02from02the02samovar02to02watch02
him02intently.02"Can02anyone02have02come02to02see02me?"02he02
wondered.02He02had02a02disgusted02vision02of02Porfiry.02But02
opening02his02door02he02saw02Dounia.02She02was02sitting02alone,02
plunged02in02deep02thought,02and02looked02as02though02she02had02
been02waiting02a02long02time.02He02stopped02short02in02the02
doorway.02She02rose02from02the02sofa02in02dismay02and02stood02up02
facing02him.02Her02eyes,02fixed02upon02him,02betrayed02horror02and02
infinite02grief.02And02from02those02eyes02alone02he02saw02at02once02
that02she02knew.0202
"Am02I02to02come02in02or02go02away?"02he02asked02uncertainly.0202
"I've02been02all02day02with02Sofya02Semyonovna.02We02were02
both02waiting02for02you.02We02thought02that02you02would02be02sure02
to02come02there."0202
Raskolnikov02went02into02the02room02and02sank02exhausted02on02
a02chair.0202
"I02feel02weak,02Dounia,02I02am02very02tired;02and02I02should02have02
liked02at02this02moment02to02be02able02to02control02myself."0202
He02glanced02at02her02mistrustfully.0202
"Where02were02you02all02night?"0202
"I02don't02remember02clearly.02You02see,02sister,02I02wanted02to02
make02up02my02mind02once02for02all,02and02several02times02I02walked02
by02the02Neva,02I02remember02that02I02wanted02to02end02it02all02there,02
but...02I02couldn't02make02up02my02mind,"02he02whispered,02looking02
at02her02mistrustfully02again.0202
"Thank02God!02That02was02just02what02we02were02afraid02of,02
Sofya02Semyonovna02and02I.02Then02you02still02have02faith02in02life?02
Thank02God,02thank02God!"0202
Raskolnikov02smiled02bitterly.0202
"I02haven't02faith,02but02I02have02just02been02weeping02in02
mother's02arms;02I02haven't02faith,02but02I02have02just02asked02her02to02
pray02for02me.02I02don't02know02how02it02is,02Dounia,02I02don't02
understand02it."0202
"Have02you02been02at02mother's?02Have02you02told02her?"02cried02
Dounia,02horror\stricken.02"Surely02you02haven't02done02that?"0202
"No,02I02didn't02tell02her...02in02words;02but02she02understood02a02
great02deal.02She02heard02you02talking02in02your02sleep.02I02am02sure02
she02half02understands02it02already.02Perhaps02I02did02wrong02in02
going02to02see02her.02I02don't02know02why02I02did02go.02I02am02a02
contemptible02person,02Dounia."0202
"A02contemptible02person,02but02ready02to02face02suffering!02
You02are,02aren't02you?"0202
"Yes,02I02am02going.02At02once.02Yes,02to02escape02the02disgrace02I02
thought02of02drowning02myself,02Dounia,02but02as02I02looked02into02
the02water,02I02thought02that02if02I02had02considered02myself02strong02
till02now02I'd02better02not02be02afraid02of02disgrace,"02he02said,02
hurrying02on.02"It's02pride,02Dounia."0202
"Pride,02Rodya."0202
There02was02a02gleam02of02fire02in02his02lustreless02eyes;02he02
seemed02to02be02glad02to02think02that02he02was02still02proud.0202
"You02don't02think,02sister,02that02I02was02simply02afraid02of02the02

smile.0202
"Oh,02Rodya,02hush!"02cried02Dounia02bitterly.02Silence02lasted02
for02two02minutes.02He02sat02with02his02eyes02fixed02on02the02floor;02
Dounia02stood02at02the02other02end02of02the02table02and02looked02at02
him02with02anguish.02Suddenly02he02got02up.0202

"You02are02crying,02sister,02but02can02you02hold02out02your02hand02
to02me?"0202
"You02doubted02it?"0202
It's02
simply02 because02
She02threw02her02arms02round02him.0202
"Aren't02you02half02expiating02your02crime02by02facing02the02
suffering?"02she02cried,02holding02him02close02and02kissing02him.0202
"Crime?02What02crime?"02he02cried02in02sudden02fury.02"That02I02
killed02a02vile02noxious02insect,02an02old02pawnbroker02woman,02of02

"Brother,02brother,02what02are02you02saying?02Why,02you02have02
shed02blood?"02cried02Dounia02in02despair.0202
"Which02all02men02shed,"02he02put02in02almost02frantically,02
"which02flows02and02has02always02flowed02in02streams,02which02is02

expression02in02Dounia's02eyes02at02his02last02words02and02
promises.02"Why02are02you02crying?02Don't02cry,02don't02cry:02we02
are02not02parting02for02ever!02Ah,02yes!02Wait02a02minute,02I'd02
forgotten!"0202
He02went02to02the02table,02took02up02a02thick02dusty02book,02
opened02it02and02took02from02between02the02pages02a02little02water\
colour02portrait02on02ivory.02It02was02the02portrait02of02his02
landlady's02daughter,02who02had02died02of02fever,02that02strange02
girl02who02had02wanted02to02be02a02nun.02For02a02minute02he02gazed02at02
the02delicate02expressive02face02of02his02betrothed,02kissed02the02
portrait02and02gave02it02to02Dounia.0202
"I02used02to02talk02a02great02deal02about02it02to02her,02only02to02her,"02
he02said02thoughtfully.02"To02her02heart02I02confided02much02of02
what02has02since02been02so02hideously02realised.02Don't02be02

is02going02to02be02broken02in02two,"02he02cried,02suddenly02returning02
to02his02dejection.02"Everything,02everything,02and02am02I02

At02last02they02both02went02out.02It02was02hard02for02Dounia,02but02
she02loved02him.02She02walked02away,02but02after02going02fifty02paces02
she02turned02round02to02look02at02him02again.02He02was02still02in02sight.02
At02the02corner02he02too02turned02and02for02the02last02time02their02eyes02
met;02but02noticing02that02she02was02looking02at02him,02he02motioned02
her02away02with02impatience02and02even02vexation,02and02turned02
the02corner02abruptly.0202
"I02am02wicked,02I02see02that,"02he02thought02to02himself,02feeling02
ashamed02a02moment02later02of02his02angry02gesture02to02Dounia.02
"But02why02are02they02so02fond02of02me02if02I02don't02deserve02it?02Oh,02if02
only02I02were02alone02and02no02one02loved02me02and02I02too02had02never02

that's02it,02that's02what02they02are02sending02me02there02for,02that's02
what02they02want.02Look02at02them02running02to02and02fro02about02the02

they'd02be02wild02with02righteous02indignation.02Oh,02how02I02hate02
them02all!"0202
He02fell02to02musing02by02what02process02it02could02come02to02pass,02
that02 he02 could02 be02 humbled02 before02 all02 of02
them,02
indiscriminately―humbled02by02conviction.02And02yet02why02
not?02It02must02be02so.02Would02not02twenty02years02of02continual02

CHAPTER02VIII0202
When02he02went02into02Sonia's02room,02it02was02already02getting02
dark.02All02day02Sonia02had02been02waiting02for02him02in02terrible02
anxiety.02Dounia02had02been02waiting02with02her.02She02had02come02
to02her02that02morning,02remembering02Svidriga07lov's02words02
that02Sonia02knew.02We02will02not02describe02the02conversation02
and02tears02of02the02two02girls,02and02how02friendly02they02became.02
Dounia02gained02one02comfort02at02least02from02that02interview,02
that02her02brother02would02not02be02alone.02He02had02gone02to02her,02
Sonia,02first02with02his02confession;02he02had02gone02to02her02for02
human02fellowship02when02he02needed02it;02she02would02go02with02
him02wherever02fate02might02send02him.02Dounia02did02not02ask,02but02
she02knew02it02was02so.02She02looked02at02Sonia02almost02with02
reverence02and02at02first02almost02embarrassed02her02by02it.02Sonia02
was02almost02on02the02point02of02tears.02She02felt02herself,02on02the02
contrary,02hardly02worthy02to02look02at02Dounia.02Dounia's02
gracious02image02when02she02had02bowed02to02her02so02attentively02
and02respectfully02at02their02first02meeting02in02Raskolnikov's02
room02had02remained02in02her02mind02as02one02of02the02fairest02
visions02of02her02life.0202
Dounia02at02last02became02impatient02and,02leaving02Sonia,02
went02to02her02brother's02room02to02await02him02there;02she02kept02
thinking02that02he02would02come02there02first.02When02she02had02
gone,02Sonia02began02to02be02tortured02by02the02dread02of02his02
committing02suicide,02and02Dounia02too02feared02it.02But02they02had02
spent02the02day02trying02to02persuade02each02other02that02that02could02
not02be,02and02both02were02less02anxious02while02they02were02
together.02As02soon02as02they02parted,02each02thought02of02nothing02
else.02Sonia02remembered02how02Svidriga07lov02had02said02to02her02
the02day02before02that02Raskolnikov02had02two02alternatives―
Siberia02or...02Besides02she02knew02his02vanity,02his02pride02and02his02
lack02of02faith.0202
"Is02it02possible02that02he02has02nothing02but02cowardice02and02
fear02of02death02to02make02him02live?"02she02thought02at02last02in02
despair.0202Meanwhile02the02sun02was02setting.02Sonia02was02standing02in02
dejection,02looking02intently02out02of02the02window,02but02from02it02
she02could02see02nothing02but02the02unwhitewashed02blank02wall02
of02the02next02house.02At02last02when02she02began02to02feel02sure02of02his02
death―he02walked02into02the02room.0202
She02gave02a02cry02of02joy,02but02looking02carefully02into02his02face02
she02turned02pale.0202
"Yes,"02said02Raskolnikov,02smiling.02"I02have02come02for02your02
cross,02Sonia.02It02was02you02told02me02to02go02to02the02cross\roads;02
why02is02it02you02are02frightened02now02it's02come02to02that?"0202
Sonia02gazed02at02him02astonished.02His02tone02seemed02strange02
to02her;02a02cold02shiver02ran02over02her,02but02in02a02moment02she02
guessed02that02the02tone02and02the02words02were02a02mask.02He02
spoke02to02her02looking02away,02as02though02to02avoid02meeting02her02
eyes.0202"You02see,02Sonia,02I've02decided02that02it02will02be02better02so.02
There02is02one02fact....02But02it's02a02long02story02and02there's02no02need02
to02discuss02it.02But02do02you02know02what02angers02me?02It02annoys02
me02that02all02those02stupid02brutish02faces02will02be02gaping02at02me02
directly,02pestering02me02with02their02stupid02questions,02which02I02
shall02have02to02answer―they'll02point02their02fingers02at02me....02
Tfoo!02You02know02I02am02not02going02to02Porfiry,02I02am02sick02of02him.02
I'd02rather02go02to02my02friend,02the02Explosive02Lieutenant;02how02I02
shall02surprise02him,02what02a02sensation02I02shall02make!02But02I02
must02be02cooler;02I've02become02too02irritable02of02late.02You02know02
I02was02nearly02shaking02my02fist02at02my02sister02just02now,02because02
she02turned02to02take02a02last02look02at02me.02It's02a02brutal02state02to02be02
in!02Ah!02what02am02I02coming02to!02Well,02where02are02the02crosses?"0202
He02seemed02hardly02to02know02what02he02was02doing.02He02could02
not02stay02still02or02concentrate02his02attention02on02anything;02his02
ideas02seemed02to02gallop02after02one02another,02he02talked02
incoherently,02his02hands02trembled02slightly.0202
Without02a02word02Sonia02took02out02of02the02drawer02two02
crosses,02one02of02cypress02wood02and02one02of02copper.02She02made02
the02sign02of02the02cross02over02herself02and02over02him,02and02put02the02
wooden02cross02on02his02neck.0202
"It's02the02symbol02of02my02taking02up02the02cross,"02he02laughed.02
"As02though02I02had02not02suffered02much02till02now!02The02wooden02
cross,02that02is02the02peasant02one;02the02copper02one,02that02is02
Lizaveta's―you02will02wear02yourself,02show02me!02So02she02had02it02
on...02at02that02moment?02I02remember02two02things02like02these02too,02
a02silver02one02and02a02little02ikon.02I02threw02them02back02on02the02old02
woman's02neck.02Those02would02be02appropriate02now,02really,02
those02are02what02I02ought02to02put02on02now....02But02I02am02talking02
nonsense02and02forgetting02what02matters;02I'm02somehow02
forgetful....02You02see02I02have02come02to02warn02you,02Sonia,02so02that02
you02might02know...02that's02all―that's02all02I02came02for.02But02I02
thought02I02had02more02to02say.02You02wanted02me02to02go02yourself.02
Well,02now02I02am02going02to02prison02and02you'll02have02your02wish.02
Well,02what02are02you02crying02for?02You02too?02Don't.02Leave02off!02
Oh,02how02I02hate02it02all!"0202
But02his02feeling02was02stirred;02his02heart02ached,02as02he02
looked02at02her.02"Why02is02she02grieving02too?"02he02thought02to02
himself.02"What02am02I02to02her?02Why02does02she02weep?02Why02is02
she02looking02after02me,02like02my02mother02or02Dounia?02She'll02be02
my02nurse."0202
"Cross02yourself,02say02at02least02one02prayer,"02Sonia02begged02
in02a02timid02broken02voice.0202
"Oh02certainly,02as02much02as02you02like!02And02sincerely,02Sonia,02
sincerely...."0202
But02he02wanted02to02say02something02quite02different.0202
He02crossed02himself02several02times.02Sonia02took02up02her02
shawl02and02put02it02over02her02head.02It02was02the02green02 drap02de02

but02he02did02not02ask.02He02began02to02feel02himself02that02he02was02
certainly02forgetting02things02and02was02disgustingly02agitated.02
He02was02frightened02at02this.02He02was02suddenly02struck02too02by02
the02thought02that02Sonia02meant02to02go02with02him.0202
"What02are02you02doing?02Where02are02you02going?02Stay02here,02
stay!02I'll02go02alone,"02he02cried02in02cowardly02vexation,02and02
almost02resentful,02he02moved02towards02the02door.02"What's02the02
use02of02going02in02procession?"02he02muttered02going02out.0202
Sonia02remained02standing02in02the02middle02of02the02room.02He02
had02not02even02said02good\bye02to02her;02he02had02forgotten02her.02A02
poignant02and02rebellious02doubt02surged02in02his02heart.0202
"Was02it02right,02was02it02right,02all02this?"02he02thought02again02as02
he02went02down02the02stairs.02"Couldn't02he02stop02and02retract02it02
all...02and02not02go?"0202
But02still02he02went.02He02felt02suddenly02once02for02all02that02he02
mustn't02ask02himself02questions.02As02he02turned02into02the02street02
he02remembered02that02he02had02not02said02good\bye02to02Sonia,02
that02he02had02left02her02in02the02middle02of02the02room02in02her02green02
shawl,02not02daring02to02stir02after02he02had02shouted02at02her,02and02
he02stopped02short02for02a02moment.02At02the02same02instant,02
another02thought02dawned02upon02him,02as02though02it02had02been02
lying02in02wait02to02strike02him02then.0202
"Why,02with02what02object02did02I02go02to02her02just02now?02I02told02

turning02out02of02his02way02along02it02went02to02the02Hay02Market.0202

distasteful02to02be02in02a02crowd,02but02he02walked02just02where02he02
saw02most02people.02He02would02have02given02anything02in02the02

drunk02and02disorderly02in02the02crowd;02he02kept02trying02to02dance02
and02
falling02 down.02 There02 was02 a02 ring02 round02 him.02
Raskolnikov02squeezed02his02way02through02the02crowd,02stared02
for02some02minutes02at02the02drunken02man02and02suddenly02gave02a02
short02jerky02laugh.02A02minute02later02he02had02forgotten02him02and02
did02not02see02him,02though02he02still02stared.02He02moved02away02at02
last,02not02remembering02where02he02was;02but02when02he02got02into02
the02middle02of02the02square02an02emotion02suddenly02came02over02
him,02overwhelming02him02body02and02mind.0202
He02suddenly02recalled02Sonia's02words,02"Go02to02the02cross\

hopeless02misery02and02anxiety02of02all02that02time,02especially02of02
the02last02hours,02had02weighed02so02heavily02upon02him02that02he02

started02into02his02eyes.02He02fell02to02the02earth02on02the02spot....0202
He02knelt02down02in02the02middle02of02the02square,02bowed02
down02to02the02earth,02and02kissed02that02filthy02earth02with02bliss02

"He's02boozed,"02a02youth02near02him02observed.0202

the02point02of02dropping02from02his02lips,02died02away.02He02bore02
these02remarks02quietly,02however,02and,02without02looking02
round,02he02turned02down02a02street02leading02to02the02police02office.02
He02had02a02glimpse02of02something02on02the02way02which02did02not02
surprise02him;02he02had02felt02that02it02must02be02so.02The02second02

him02behind02one02of02the02wooden02shanties02in02the02market\

Raskolnikov02at02that02moment02felt02and02knew02once02for02all02that02
Sonia02was02with02him02for02ever02and02would02follow02him02to02the02
ends02of02the02earth,02wherever02fate02might02take02him.02It02wrung02
his02heart...02but02he02was02just02reaching02the02fatal02place.0202
He02went02into02the02yard02fairly02resolutely.02He02had02to02
mount02to02the02third02storey.02"I02shall02be02some02time02going02up,"02
he02thought.02He02felt02as02though02the02fateful02moment02was02still02
left02 for02
far02 off,02 as02 though02 he02 had02 plenty02 of02 time02
consideration.0202
Again02the02same02rubbish,02the02same02eggshells02lying02about02
on02the02spiral02stairs,02again02the02open02doors02of02the02flats,02again02

His02legs02were02numb02and02gave02way02under02him,02but02still02they02
moved02forward.02He02stopped02for02a02moment02to02take02breath,02
to02collect02himself,02so02as02to02enter02 like02 a02 man.02"But02why?02
what02for?"02he02wondered,02reflecting.02"If02I02must02drink02the02
cup02what02difference02does02it02make?02The02more02revolting02the02
better."02He02imagined02for02an02instant02the02figure02of02the02
"explosive02lieutenant,"02Ilya02Petrovitch.02Was02he02actually02
going02to02him?02Couldn't02he02go02to02someone02else?02To02Nikodim02
Fomitch?02Couldn't02he02turn02back02and02go02straight02to02Nikodim02
Fomitch's02lodgings?02At02least02then02it02would02be02done02
privately....02No,02no!02To02the02"explosive02lieutenant"!02If02he02
must02drink02it,02drink02it02off02at02once.0202
Turning02cold02and02hardly02conscious,02he02opened02the02door02
of02the02office.02There02were02very02few02people02in02it02this02time―
only02a02house02porter02and02a02peasant.02The02doorkeeper02did02not02
even02peep02out02from02behind02his02screen.02Raskolnikov02walked02
into02the02next02room.02"Perhaps02I02still02need02not02speak,"02passed02
through02his02mind.02Some02sort02of02clerk02not02wearing02a02
uniform02was02settling02himself02at02a02bureau02to02write.02In02a02
corner02another02clerk02was02seating02himself.02Zametov02was02
not02there,02nor,02of02course,02Nikodim02Fomitch.0202
"No02one02in?"02Raskolnikov02asked,02addressing02the02person02
at02the02bureau.0202
"Whom02do02you02want?"0202
"A\ah!02Not02a02sound02was02heard,02not02a02sight02was02seen,02but02

"It02is02the02hand02of02fate,"02thought02Raskolnikov.02"Why02is02he02
here?"0202
"You've02come02to02see02us?02What02about?"02cried02Ilya02
Petrovitch.02He02was02obviously02in02an02exceedingly02good02
humour02and02perhaps02a02trifle02exhilarated.02"If02it's02on02

besides02I02have02rank,02consequence,02a02post!02I02am02married02and02

education...02Then02these02midwives,02too,02have02become02
extraordinarily02numerous."0202
Raskolnikov02raised02his02eyebrows02inquiringly.02The02
words02of02Ilya02Petrovitch,02who02had02obviously02been02dining,02
were02for02the02most02part02a02stream02of02empty02sounds02for02him.02
But02some02of02them02he02understood.02He02looked02at02him02
inquiringly,02not02knowing02how02it02would02end.0202
"I02mean02those02crop\headed02wenches,"02the02talkative02Ilya02
Petrovitch02continued.02"Midwives02is02my02name02for02them.02I02
think02it02a02very02satisfactory02one,02ha\ha!02They02go02to02the02
Academy,02study02anatomy.02If02I02fall02ill,02am02I02to02send02for02a02
young02lady02to02treat02me?02What02do02you02say?02Ha\ha!"02Ilya02
Petrovitch02laughed,02quite02pleased02with02his02own02wit.02"It's02an02
immoderate02zeal02for02education,02but02once02you're02educated,02
that's02enough.02Why02abuse02it?02Why02insult02honourable02
people,02as02that02scoundrel02Zametov02does?02Why02did02he02insult02
me,02I02ask02you?02Look02at02these02suicides,02too,02how02common02
they02 are,02 you02 can't02 fancy!02 People02 spend02 their02
last02
halfpenny02and02kill02themselves,02boys02and02girls02and02old02
people.02Only02this02morning02we02heard02about02a02gentleman02
who02had02just02come02to02town.02Nil02Pavlitch,02I02say,02what02was02
the02name02of02that02gentleman02who02shot02himself?"0202
"Svidriga07lov,"02someone02answered02from02the02other02room02
with02drowsy02listlessness.0202
Raskolnikov02started.0202
"Svidriga07lov!02Svidriga07lov02has02shot02himself!"02he02cried.0202
"What,02do02you02know02Svidriga07lov?"0202
"Yes...02I02knew02him....02He02hadn't02been02here02long."0202
"Yes,02that's02so.02He02had02lost02his02wife,02was02a02man02of02
reckless02habits02and02all02of02a02sudden02shot02himself,02and02in02
such02a02shocking02way....02He02left02in02his02notebook02a02few02words:02
that02he02dies02in02full02possession02of02his02faculties02and02that02no02
one02is02to02blame02for02his02death.02He02had02money,02they02say.02How02
did02you02come02to02know02him?"0202
"I...02was02acquainted...02my02sister02was02governess02in02his02
family."0202
"Bah\bah\bah!02Then02no02doubt02you02can02tell02us02something02
about02him.02You02had02no02suspicion?"0202
"I02saw02him02yesterday...02he...02was02drinking02wine;02I02knew02
nothing."0202
Raskolnikov02felt02as02though02something02had02fallen02on02him02
and02was02stifling02him.0202
"You've02turned02pale02again.02It's02so02stuffy02here..."0202
"Yes,02I02must02go,"02muttered02Raskolnikov.02"Excuse02my02
troubling02you...."0202
"Oh,02not02at02all,02as02often02as02you02like.02It's02a02pleasure02to02see02
you02and02I02am02glad02to02say02so."0202
Ilya02Petrovitch02held02out02his02hand.0202
"I02only02wanted...02I02came02to02see02Zametov."0202
"I02understand,02I02understand,02and02it's02a02pleasure02to02see02
you."0202"I...02am02very02glad...02good\bye,"02Raskolnikov02smiled.0202
He02went02out;02he02reeled,02he02was02overtaken02with02
giddiness02and02did02not02know02what02he02was02doing.02He02began02
going02down02the02stairs,02supporting02himself02with02his02right02
hand02against02the02wall.02He02fancied02that02a02porter02pushed02past02
him02on02his02way02upstairs02to02the02police02office,02that02a02dog02in02
the02lower02storey02kept02up02a02shrill02barking02and02that02a02woman02
flung02a02rolling\pin02at02it02and02shouted.02He02went02down02and02
out02into02the02yard.02There,02not02far02from02the02entrance,02stood02
Sonia,02pale02and02horror\stricken.02She02looked02wildly02at02him.02
He02stood02still02before02her.02There02was02a02look02of02poignant02
agony,02of02despair,02in02her02face.02She02clasped02her02hands.02His02
lips02worked02in02an02ugly,02meaningless02smile.02He02stood02still02a02
minute,02grinned02and02went02back02to02the02police02office.0202
Ilya02Petrovitch02had02sat02down02and02was02rummaging02
among02some02papers.02Before02him02stood02the02same02peasant02
who02had02pushed02by02on02the02stairs.0202
"Hulloa!02Back02again!02have02you02left02something02behind?02
What's02the02matter?"0202
Raskolnikov,02with02white02lips02and02staring02eyes,02came02
slowly02nearer.02He02walked02right02to02the02table,02leaned02his02
hand02on02it,02tried02to02say02something,02but02could02not;02only02
incoherent02sounds02were02audible.0202
"You02are02feeling02ill,02a02chair!02Here,02sit02down!02Some02
water!"0202
Raskolnikov02dropped02on02to02a02chair,02but02he02kept02his02eyes02
fixed02on02the02face02of02Ilya02Petrovitch,02which02expressed02
unpleasant02surprise.02Both02looked02at02one02another02for02a02
minute02and02waited.02Water02was02brought.0202
"It02was02I..."02began02Raskolnikov.0202
"Drink02some02water."0202
Raskolnikov02refused02the02water02with02his02hand,02and02softly02
and02brokenly,02but02distinctly02said:0202
"It02was02I02killed02the02old02pawnbroker02woman02and02her02sister02
Lizaveta02with02an02axe02and02robbed02them."0202
Ilya02Petrovitch02opened02his02mouth.02People02ran02up02on02all02
sides.0202Raskolnikov02repeated02his02statement.0202

Siberia.02On02the02banks02of02a02broad02solitary02river02stands02a02
town,02one02of02the02administrative02centres02of02Russia;02in02the02
town02there02is02a02fortress,02in02the02fortress02there02is02a02prison.02In02
the02prison02the02second\class02convict02Rodion02Raskolnikov02
has02been02confined02for02nine02months.02Almost02a02year02and02a02
half02has02passed02since02his02crime.0202
There02had02been02little02difficulty02about02his02trial.02The02
criminal02adhered02exactly,02firmly,02and02clearly02to02his02
statement.02He02did02not02confuse02nor02misrepresent02the02facts,02
nor02soften02them02in02his02own02interest,02nor02omit02the02smallest02
detail.02He02explained02every02incident02of02the02murder,02the02
secret02of02 the02 pledge02(the02piece02of02wood02with02a02strip02of02
metal)02which02was02found02in02the02murdered02woman's02hand.02
He02described02minutely02how02he02had02taken02her02keys,02what02
they02were02like,02as02well02as02the02chest02and02its02contents;02he02
explained02the02mystery02of02Lizaveta's02murder;02described02
how02Koch02and,02after02him,02the02student02knocked,02and02
repeated02all02they02had02said02to02one02another;02how02he02
afterwards02had02run02downstairs02and02heard02Nikolay02and02
Dmitri02shouting;02how02he02had02hidden02in02the02empty02flat02and02
afterwards02gone02home.02He02ended02by02indicating02the02stone02in02
the02yard02off02the02Voznesensky02Prospect02under02which02the02
purse02and02the02trinkets02were02found.02The02whole02thing,02in02
fact,02was02perfectly02clear.02The02lawyers02and02the02judges02were02
very02much02struck,02among02other02things,02by02the02fact02that02he02
had02hidden02the02trinkets02and02the02purse02under02a02stone,02
without02making02use02of02them,02and02that,02what02was02more,02he02
did02not02now02remember02what02the02trinkets02were02like,02or02
even02how02many02there02were.02The02fact02that02he02had02never02
opened02the02purse02and02did02not02even02know02how02much02was02in02
it02seemed02incredible.02There02turned02out02to02be02in02the02purse02
three02hundred02and02seventeen02roubles02and02sixty02copecks.02
From02being02so02long02under02the02stone,02some02of02the02most02
valuable02notes02lying02uppermost02had02suffered02from02the02
damp.02They02were02a02long02while02trying02to02discover02why02the02
accused02man02should02tell02a02lie02about02this,02when02about02
everything02 else02 he02 had02 made02 a02
and02
truthful02
straightforward02confession.02Finally02some02of02the02lawyers02
more02versed02in02psychology02admitted02that02it02was02possible02
he02had02really02not02looked02into02the02purse,02and02so02didn't02know02
what02was02in02it02when02he02hid02it02under02the02stone.02But02they02
immediately02drew02the02deduction02that02the02crime02could02only02
through02
have02 been02 committed02
temporary02 mental02
derangement,02through02homicidal02mania,02without02object02or02
the02pursuit02of02gain.02This02fell02in02with02the02most02recent02
fashionable02theory02of02temporary02insanity,02so02often02applied02
in02our02days02in02criminal02cases.02Moreover02Raskolnikov's02
hypochondriacal02
condition02 was02 proved02 by02 many02
witnesses,02by02Dr.02Zossimov,02his02former02fellow02students,02his02
landlady02and02her02servant.02All02this02pointed02strongly02to02the02
conclusion02that02Raskolnikov02was02not02quite02like02an02ordinary02
murderer02and02robber,02but02that02there02was02another02element02
in02the02case.0202
To02the02intense02annoyance02of02those02who02maintained02this02
opinion,02the02criminal02scarcely02attempted02to02defend02himself.02
To02the02decisive02question02as02to02what02motive02impelled02him02
to02the02murder02and02the02robbery,02he02answered02very02clearly02
with02the02coarsest02frankness02that02the02cause02was02his02
miserable02position,02his02poverty02and02helplessness,02and02his02
desire02to02provide02for02his02first02steps02in02life02by02the02help02of02the02
three02thousand02roubles02he02had02reckoned02on02finding.02He02
had02been02led02to02the02murder02through02his02shallow02and02
cowardly02nature,02exasperated02moreover02by02privation02and02
failure.02To02the02question02what02led02him02to02confess,02he02
answered02that02it02was02his02heartfelt02repentance.02All02this02was02
almost02coarse....0202
The02sentence02however02was02more02merciful02than02could02
have02been02expected,02perhaps02partly02because02the02criminal02
had02not02tried02to02justify02himself,02but02had02rather02shown02a02
desire02to02exaggerate02his02guilt.02All02the02strange02and02peculiar02
circumstances02of02the02crime02were02taken02into02consideration.02
There02could02be02no02doubt02of02the02abnormal02and02poverty\
stricken02condition02of02the02criminal02at02the02time.02The02fact02that02
he02had02made02no02use02of02what02he02had02stolen02was02put02down02
partly02to02the02effect02of02remorse,02partly02to02his02abnormal02
mental02condition02at02the02time02of02the02crime.02Incidentally02the02
murder02of02Lizaveta02served02indeed02to02confirm02the02last02
hypothesis:02a02man02commits02two02murders02and02forgets02that02
the02door02is02open!02Finally,02the02confession,02at02the02very02
moment02when02the02case02was02hopelessly02muddled02by02the02
false02evidence02given02by02Nikolay02through02melancholy02and02
fanaticism,02and02when,02moreover,02there02were02no02proofs02
against02the02real02criminal,02no02suspicions02even02(Porfiry02
Petrovitch02fully02kept02his02word)―all02this02did02much02to02
soften02the02sentence.02Other02circumstances,02too,02in02the02
prisoner's02favour02came02out02quite02unexpectedly.02Razumihin02
somehow02discovered02and02proved02that02while02Raskolnikov02
was02at02the02university02he02had02helped02a02poor02consumptive02
fellow02student02and02had02spent02his02last02penny02on02supporting02
him02for02six02months,02and02when02this02student02died,02leaving02a02
decrepit02old02father02whom02he02had02maintained02almost02from02
his02thirteenth02year,02Raskolnikov02had02got02the02old02man02into02a02
hospital02 and02 paid02
funeral02 when02 he02 died.02
Raskolnikov's02landlady02bore02witness,02too,02that02when02they02
for02 his02
had02lived02in02another02house02at02Five02Corners,02Raskolnikov02
had02rescued02two02little02children02from02a02house02on02fire02and02
was02burnt02in02doing02so.02This02was02investigated02and02fairly02
well02confirmed02by02many02witnesses.02These02facts02made02an02
impression02in02his02favour.0202
And02in02the02end02the02criminal02was,02in02consideration02of02
extenuating02circumstances,02condemned02to02penal02servitude02
in02the02second02class02for02a02term02of02eight02years02only.0202
At02the02very02beginning02of02the02trial02Raskolnikov's02mother02
fell02ill.02Dounia02and02Razumihin02found02it02possible02to02get02her02
out02of02Petersburg02during02the02trial.02Razumihin02chose02a02town02
on02the02railway02not02far02from02Petersburg,02so02as02to02be02able02to02
follow02every02step02of02the02trial02and02at02the02same02time02to02see02
Avdotya02Romanovna02as02often02as02possible.02Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna's02illness02was02a02strange02nervous02one02and02was02
accompanied02by02a02partial02derangement02of02her02intellect.0202
When02Dounia02returned02from02her02last02interview02with02her02
brother,02she02had02found02her02mother02already02ill,02in02feverish02
delirium.02That02evening02Razumihin02and02she02agreed02what02
answers02they02must02make02to02her02mother's02questions02about02
Raskolnikov02and02made02up02a02complete02story02for02her02
mother's02benefit02of02his02having02to02go02away02to02a02distant02part02
of02Russia02on02a02business02commission,02which02would02bring02
him02in02the02end02money02and02reputation.0202
But02they02were02struck02by02the02fact02that02Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna02never02asked02them02anything02on02the02subject,02
neither02then02nor02thereafter.02On02the02contrary,02she02had02her02
own02version02of02her02son's02sudden02departure;02she02told02them02
with02tears02how02he02had02come02to02say02good\bye02to02her,02
hinting02that02she02alone02knew02many02mysterious02and02
important02facts,02and02that02Rodya02had02many02very02powerful02
enemies,02so02that02it02was02necessary02for02him02to02be02in02hiding.02
As02for02his02future02career,02she02had02no02doubt02that02it02would02be02
brilliant02 when02 certain02 sinister02
influences02 could02 be02
removed.02She02assured02Razumihin02that02her02son02would02be02
one02day02a02great02statesman,02that02his02article02and02brilliant02
literary02talent02proved02it.02This02article02she02was02continually02
reading,02she02even02read02it02aloud,02almost02took02it02to02bed02with02
her,02but02scarcely02asked02where02Rodya02was,02though02the02
subject02was02obviously02avoided02by02the02others,02which02might02
have02been02enough02to02awaken02her02suspicions.0202
They02began02to02be02frightened02at02last02at02Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna's02strange02silence02on02certain02subjects.02She02did02
not,02for02instance,02complain02of02getting02no02letters02from02him,02
though02in02previous02years02she02had02only02lived02on02the02hope02of02
letters02from02her02beloved02Rodya.02This02was02the02cause02of02
great02uneasiness02to02Dounia;02the02idea02occurred02to02her02that02
her02mother02suspected02that02there02was02something02terrible02in02
her02son's02fate02and02was02afraid02to02ask,02for02fear02of02hearing02
something02still02more02awful.02In02any02case,02Dounia02saw02
clearly02that02her02mother02was02not02in02full02possession02of02her02
faculties.0202
It02happened02once02or02twice,02however,02that02Pulcheria02
Alexandrovna02gave02such02a02turn02to02the02conversation02that02it02
was02impossible02to02answer02her02without02mentioning02where02
Rodya02was,02and02on02receiving02unsatisfactory02and02suspicious02
answers02she02became02at02once02gloomy02and02silent,02and02this02
mood02lasted02for02a02long02time.02Dounia02saw02at02last02that02it02was02
hard02to02deceive02her02and02came02to02the02conclusion02that02it02was02
better02to02be02absolutely02silent02on02certain02points;02but02it02
became02more02and02more02evident02that02the02poor02mother02
suspected02something02terrible.02Dounia02remembered02her02
brother's02telling02her02that02her02mother02had02overheard02her02
talking02in02her02sleep02on02the02night02after02her02interview02with02
Svidriga07lov02and02before02the02fatal02day02of02the02confession:02had02
not02she02made02out02something02from02that?02Sometimes02days02
and02even02weeks02of02gloomy02silence02and02tears02would02be02
succeeded02by02a02period02of02hysterical02animation,02and02the02
invalid02would02begin02to02talk02almost02incessantly02of02her02son,02
of02her02hopes02of02his02future....02Her02fancies02were02sometimes02
very02strange.02They02humoured02her,02pretended02to02agree02with02
her02(she02saw02perhaps02that02they02were02pretending),02but02she02
still02went02on02talking.0202
Five02months02after02Raskolnikov's02confession,02he02was02
sentenced.02Razumihin02and02Sonia02saw02him02in02prison02as02
often02as02it02was02possible.02At02last02the02moment02of02separation02
came.02Dounia02swore02to02her02brother02that02the02separation02
should02 not02 be02 for02 ever,02 Razumihin02 did02 the02 same.02
Razumihin,02in02his02youthful02ardour,02had02firmly02resolved02to02
lay02the02foundations02at02least02of02a02secure02livelihood02during02
the02next02three02or02four02years,02and02saving02up02a02certain02sum,02
to02emigrate02to02Siberia,02a02country02rich02in02every02natural02
resource02and02in02need02of02workers,02active02men02and02capital.02
There02they02would02settle02in02the02town02where02Rodya02was02and02
all02together02would02begin02a02new02life.02They02all02wept02at02
parting.0202
Raskolnikov02had02been02very02dreamy02for02a02few02days02
before.02He02asked02a02great02deal02about02his02mother02and02was02
constantly02anxious02about02her.02He02worried02so02much02about02
her02that02it02alarmed02Dounia.02When02he02heard02about02his02
mother's02illness02he02became02very02gloomy.02With02Sonia02he02
was02particularly02reserved02all02the02time.02With02the02help02of02the02
money02left02to02her02by02Svidriga07lov,02Sonia02had02long02ago02made02
her02preparations02to02follow02the02party02of02convicts02in02which02
he02was02despatched02to02Siberia.02Not02a02word02passed02between02
Raskolnikov02and02her02on02the02subject,02but02both02knew02it02
would02be02so.02At02the02final02leave\taking02he02smiled02strangely02
at02his02sister's02and02Razumihin's02fervent02anticipations02of02
their02happy02future02together02when02he02should02come02out02of02
prison.02He02predicted02that02their02mother's02illness02would02
soon02have02a02fatal02ending.02Sonia02and02he02at02last02set02off.0202
Two02months02later02Dounia02was02married02to02Razumihin.02It02
was02a02quiet02and02sorrowful02wedding;02Porfiry02Petrovitch02and02
Zossimov02were02invited02however.02During02all02this02period02
Razumihin02wore02an02air02of02resolute02determination.02Dounia02
put02implicit02faith02in02his02carrying02out02his02plans02and02indeed02
she02could02not02but02believe02in02him.02He02displayed02a02rare02
strength02of02will.02Among02other02things02he02began02attending02
university02lectures02again02in02order02to02take02his02degree.02They02
were02continually02making02plans02for02the02future;02both02
counted02on02settling02in02Siberia02within02five02years02at02least.02Till02
then02they02rested02their02hopes02on02Sonia.0202
Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02was02delighted02to02give02her02
blessing02to02Dounia's02marriage02with02Razumihin;02but02after02
the02marriage02she02became02even02more02melancholy02and02
anxious.02To02give02her02pleasure02Razumihin02told02her02how02
Raskolnikov02had02looked02after02the02poor02student02and02his02
decrepit02father02and02how02a02year02ago02he02had02been02burnt02and02
injured02in02rescuing02two02little02children02from02a02fire.02These02
two02pieces02of02news02excited02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna's02
disordered02
imagination02 almost02 to02 ecstasy.02 She02 was02
continually02 talking02 about02 them,02 even02 entering02
into02
conversation02with02strangers02in02the02street,02though02Dounia02
always02accompanied02her.02In02public02conveyances02and02
shops,02wherever02she02could02capture02a02listener,02she02would02
begin02the02discourse02about02her02son,02his02article,02how02he02had02
helped02the02student,02how02he02had02been02burnt02at02the02fire,02and02
so02on!02Dounia02did02not02know02how02to02restrain02her.02Apart02
from02the02danger02of02her02morbid02excitement,02there02was02the02
risk02of02someone's02recalling02Raskolnikov's02name02and02
speaking02of02the02recent02trial.02Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02found02
out02the02address02of02the02mother02of02the02two02children02her02son02
had02saved02and02insisted02on02going02to02see02her.0202
At02last02her02restlessness02reached02an02extreme02point.02She02
would02sometimes02begin02to02cry02suddenly02and02was02often02ill02
and02feverishly02delirious.02One02morning02she02declared02that02by02
her02reckoning02Rodya02ought02soon02to02be02home,02that02she02
remembered02when02he02said02good\bye02to02her02he02said02that02
they02must02expect02him02back02in02nine02months.02She02began02to02
prepare02for02his02coming,02began02to02do02up02her02room02for02him,02
to02clean02the02furniture,02to02wash02and02put02up02new02hangings02
and02so02on.02Dounia02was02anxious,02but02said02nothing02and02
helped02her02to02arrange02the02room.02After02a02fatiguing02day02spent02
in02continual02fancies,02in02joyful02day\dreams02and02tears,02
Pulcheria02Alexandrovna02was02taken02ill02in02the02night02and02by02
morning02she02was02feverish02and02delirious.02It02was02brain02fever.02
She02died02within02a02fortnight.02In02her02delirium02she02dropped02
words02which02showed02that02she02knew02a02great02deal02more02
about02her02son's02terrible02fate02than02they02had02supposed.0202
For02a02long02time02Raskolnikov02did02not02know02of02his02
mother's02death,02though02a02regular02correspondence02had02
been02maintained02from02the02time02he02reached02Siberia.02It02was02
carried02on02by02means02of02Sonia,02who02wrote02every02month02to02
the02Razumihins02and02received02an02answer02with02unfailing02

unsatisfactory,02but02later02on02they02came02to02the02conclusion02
that02the02letters02could02not02be02better,02for02from02these02letters02
they02received02a02complete02picture02of02their02unfortunate02

of\fact02detail,02the02simplest02and02clearest02description02of02all02
Raskolnikov's02surroundings02as02a02convict.02There02was02no02

his02health,02what02he02asked02for02at02their02interviews,02what02

But02Dounia02and02her02husband02could02get02little02comfort02
out02of02the02news,02especially02at02first.02Sonia02wrote02that02he02was02

She02wrote02that02his02health02was02satisfactory;02he02did02his02work02

meant02by02crime?02My02conscience02is02at02rest.02Of02course,02it02was02
a02legal02crime,02of02course,02the02letter02of02the02law02was02broken02
and02blood02was02shed.02Well,02punish02me02for02the02letter02of02the02
law...02and02that's02enough.02Of02course,02in02that02case02many02of02the02
benefactors02 of02 mankind02 who02 snatched02 power02
for02
themselves02instead02of02inheriting02it02ought02to02have02been02
punished02at02their02first02steps.02But02those02men02succeeded02and02
so02 they02were02right,02and02I02didn't,02and02so02I02had02no02right02to02
have02taken02that02step."0202
It02was02only02in02that02that02he02recognised02his02criminality,02
only02in02the02fact02that02he02had02been02unsuccessful02and02had02
confessed02it.0202
He02suffered02too02from02the02question:02why02had02he02not02
killed02himself?02Why02had02he02stood02looking02at02the02river02and02
preferred02to02confess?02Was02the02desire02to02live02so02strong02and02
was02it02so02hard02to02overcome02it?02Had02not02Svidriga07lov02
overcome02it,02although02he02was02afraid02of02death?0202
In02misery02he02asked02himself02this02question,02and02could02not02
understand02that,02at02the02very02time02he02had02been02standing02
looking02into02the02river,02he02had02perhaps02been02dimly02
conscious02of02the02fundamental02falsity02in02himself02and02his02
convictions.02He02didn't02understand02that02that02consciousness02
might02be02the02promise02of02a02future02crisis,02of02a02new02view02of02
life02and02of02his02future02resurrection.0202
He02preferred02to02attribute02it02to02the02dead02weight02of02
instinct02which02he02could02not02step02over,02again02through02
weakness02and02meanness.02He02looked02at02his02fellow02prisoners02
and02was02amazed02to02see02how02they02all02loved02life02and02prized02
it.02It02seemed02to02him02that02they02loved02and02valued02life02more02in02
prison02than02in02freedom.02What02terrible02agonies02and02
privations02some02of02them,02the02tramps02for02instance,02had02
endured!02Could02they02care02so02much02for02a02ray02of02sunshine,02
for02the02primeval02forest,02the02cold02spring02hidden02away02in02
some02unseen02spot,02which02the02tramp02had02marked02three02
years02before,02and02longed02to02see02again,02as02he02might02to02see02
his02sweetheart,02dreaming02of02the02green02grass02round02it02and02
the02bird02singing02in02the02bush?02As02he02went02on02he02saw02still02
more02inexplicable02examples.0202
In02prison,02of02course,02there02was02a02great02deal02he02did02not02
see02and02did02not02want02to02see;02he02lived02as02it02were02with02
downcast02eyes.02It02was02loathsome02and02unbearable02for02him02
to02look.02But02in02the02end02there02was02much02that02surprised02him02
and02he02began,02as02it02were02involuntarily,02to02notice02much02that02
he02had02not02suspected02before.02What02surprised02him02most02of02
all02was02the02terrible02impossible02gulf02that02lay02between02him02
and02all02the02rest.02They02seemed02to02be02a02different02species,02and02
he02looked02at02them02and02they02at02him02with02distrust02and02
hostility.02He02felt02and02knew02the02reasons02of02his02isolation,02but02
he02would02never02have02admitted02till02then02that02those02reasons02
were02so02deep02and02strong.02There02were02some02Polish02exiles,02
political02prisoners,02among02them.02They02simply02looked02down02
upon02all02the02rest02as02ignorant02churls;02but02Raskolnikov02could02
not02look02upon02them02like02that.02He02saw02that02these02ignorant02
men02were02in02many02respects02far02wiser02than02the02Poles.02There02
were02some02Russians02who02were02just02as02contemptuous,02a02
former02officer02and02two02seminarists.02Raskolnikov02saw02their02
mistake02as02clearly.02He02was02disliked02and02avoided02by02
everyone;02they02even02began02to02hate02him02at02last―why,02he02
could02not02tell.02Men02who02had02been02far02more02guilty02despised02
and02laughed02at02his02crime.0202
"You're02a02gentleman,"02they02used02to02say.02"You02shouldn't02
hack02about02with02an02axe;02that's02not02a02gentleman's02work."0202
The02second02week02in02Lent,02his02turn02came02to02take02the02
sacrament02with02his02gang.02He02went02to02church02and02prayed02
with02the02others.02A02quarrel02broke02out02one02day,02he02did02not02
know02how.02All02fell02on02him02at02once02in02a02fury.0202
"You're02an02infidel!02You02don't02believe02in02God,"02they02
shouted.02"You02ought02to02be02killed."0202
He02had02never02talked02to02them02about02God02nor02his02belief,02
but02they02wanted02to02kill02him02as02an02infidel.02He02said02nothing.02
One02of02the02prisoners02rushed02at02him02in02a02perfect02frenzy.02
Raskolnikov02 awaited02 him02 calmly02 and02 silently;02 his02
eyebrows02did02not02quiver,02his02face02did02not02flinch.02The02guard02
succeeded02in02intervening02between02him02and02his02assailant,02
or02there02would02have02been02bloodshed.0202
There02was02another02question02he02could02not02decide:02why02
were02they02all02so02fond02of02Sonia?02She02did02not02try02to02win02their02
favour;02she02rarely02met02them,02sometimes02only02she02came02to02
see02him02at02work02for02a02moment.02And02yet02everybody02knew02
her,02they02knew02that02she02had02come02out02to02follow02him,02knew02
how02and02where02she02lived.02She02never02gave02them02money,02did02
them02no02particular02services.02Only02once02at02Christmas02she02
sent02them02all02presents02of02pies02and02rolls.02But02by02degrees02
closer02relations02sprang02up02between02them02and02Sonia.02She02
would02write02and02post02letters02for02them02to02their02relations.02
Relations02of02the02prisoners02who02visited02the02town,02at02their02
instructions,02left02with02Sonia02presents02and02money02for02them.02
Their02wives02and02sweethearts02knew02her02and02used02to02visit02
her.02And02when02she02visited02Raskolnikov02at02work,02or02met02a02
party02of02the02prisoners02on02the02road,02they02all02took02off02their02
hats02to02her.02"Little02mother02Sofya02Semyonovna,02you02are02our02
dear,02good02little02mother,"02coarse02branded02criminals02said02to02
that02frail02little02creature.02She02would02smile02and02bow02to02them02
and02everyone02was02delighted02when02she02smiled.02They02even02
admired02her02gait02and02turned02round02to02watch02her02walking;02
they02admired02her02too02for02being02so02little,02and,02in02fact,02did02not02
know02what02to02admire02her02most02for.02They02even02came02to02her02
for02help02in02their02illnesses.0202
He02was02in02the02hospital02from02the02middle02of02Lent02till02after02
Easter.02When02he02was02better,02he02remembered02the02dreams02
he02had02had02while02he02was02feverish02and02delirious.02He02dreamt02
that02the02whole02world02was02condemned02to02a02terrible02new02
strange02plague02that02had02come02to02Europe02from02the02depths02
of02Asia.02All02were02to02be02destroyed02except02a02very02few02chosen.02
Some02new02sorts02of02microbes02were02attacking02the02bodies02of02
men,02but02these02microbes02were02endowed02with02intelligence02
and02will.02Men02attacked02by02them02became02at02once02mad02and02
furious.02But02never02had02men02considered02themselves02so02
intellectual02and02so02completely02in02possession02of02the02truth02as02
these02sufferers,02never02had02they02considered02their02decisions,02
their02scientific02conclusions,02their02moral02convictions02so02
infallible.02Whole02villages,02whole02towns02and02peoples02went02
mad02from02the02infection.02All02were02excited02and02did02not02
understand02one02another.02Each02thought02that02he02alone02had02
the02truth02and02was02wretched02looking02at02the02others,02beat02
himself02on02the02breast,02wept,02and02wrung02his02hands.02They02
did02not02know02how02to02judge02and02could02not02agree02what02to02
consider02evil02and02what02good;02they02did02not02know02whom02to02
blame,02whom02to02justify.02Men02killed02each02other02in02a02sort02of02
senseless02spite.02They02gathered02together02in02armies02against02
one02another,02but02even02on02the02march02the02armies02would02
begin02attacking02each02other,02the02ranks02would02be02broken02and02
the02soldiers02would02fall02on02each02other,02stabbing02and02cutting,02
biting02and02devouring02each02other.02The02alarm02bell02was02
ringing02all02day02long02in02the02towns;02men02rushed02together,02but02
why02they02were02summoned02and02who02was02summoning02them02
no02one02knew.02The02most02ordinary02trades02were02abandoned,02
because02everyone02proposed02his02own02ideas,02his02own02
improvements,02and02they02could02not02agree.02The02land02too02was02
abandoned.02Men02met02in02groups,02agreed02on02something,02
swore02to02keep02together,02but02at02once02began02on02something02
quite02different02from02what02they02had02proposed.02They02
accused02one02another,02fought02and02killed02each02other.02There02
were02conflagrations02and02famine.02All02men02and02all02things02
were02involved02in02destruction.02The02plague02spread02and02
moved02further02and02further.02Only02a02few02men02could02be02saved02
in02the02whole02world.02They02were02a02pure02chosen02people,02
destined02to02found02a02new02race02and02a02new02life,02to02renew02and02
purify02the02earth,02but02no02one02had02seen02these02men,02no02one02
had02heard02their02words02and02their02voices.0202
Raskolnikov02was02worried02that02this02senseless02dream02
haunted02his02memory02so02miserably,02the02impression02of02this02
feverish02delirium02persisted02so02long.02The02second02week02after02
Easter02had02come.02There02were02warm02bright02spring02days;02in02
the02prison02ward02the02grating02windows02under02which02the02
sentinel02paced02were02opened.02Sonia02had02only02been02able02to02
visit02him02twice02during02his02illness;02each02time02she02had02to02
obtain02permission,02and02it02was02difficult.02But02she02often02used02
to02come02to02the02hospital02yard,02especially02in02the02evening,02
sometimes02only02to02stand02a02minute02and02look02up02at02the02
windows02of02the02ward.0202
One02 evening,02 when02 he02 was02 almost02 well02 again,02
Raskolnikov02fell02asleep.02On02waking02up02he02chanced02to02go02to02
the02window,02and02at02once02saw02Sonia02in02the02distance02at02the02
hospital02gate.02She02seemed02to02be02waiting02for02someone.02
Something02stabbed02him02to02the02heart02at02that02minute.02He02
shuddered02and02moved02away02from02the02window.02Next02day02
Sonia02did02not02come,02nor02the02day02after;02he02noticed02that02he02
was02expecting02her02uneasily.02At02last02he02was02discharged.02On02
reaching02the02prison02he02learnt02from02the02convicts02that02Sofya02
Semyonovna02was02lying02ill02at02home02and02was02unable02to02go02
out.0202He02was02very02uneasy02and02sent02to02inquire02after02her;02he02
soon02learnt02that02her02illness02was02not02dangerous.02Hearing02
that02he02was02anxious02about02her,02Sonia02sent02him02a02pencilled02
note,02telling02him02that02she02was02much02better,02that02she02had02a02
slight02cold02and02that02she02would02soon,02very02soon02come02and02
see02him02at02his02work.02His02heart02throbbed02painfully02as02he02
read02it.0202
Again02it02was02a02warm02bright02day.02Early02in02the02morning,02at02
six02o'clock,02he02went02off02to02work02on02the02river02bank,02where02
they02used02to02pound02alabaster02and02where02there02was02a02kiln02
for02baking02it02in02a02shed.02There02were02only02three02of02them02sent.02
One02of02the02convicts02went02with02the02guard02to02the02fortress02to02
fetch02a02tool;02the02other02began02getting02the02wood02ready02and02
laying02it02in02the02kiln.02Raskolnikov02came02out02of02the02shed02on02to02
the02river02bank,02sat02down02on02a02heap02of02logs02by02the02shed02and02
began02gazing02at02the02wide02deserted02river.02From02the02high02
bank02a02broad02landscape02opened02before02him,02the02sound02of02
singing02floated02faintly02audible02from02the02other02bank.02In02the02
vast02steppe,02bathed02in02sunshine,02he02could02just02see,02like02
black02specks,02the02nomads'02tents.02There02there02was02freedom,02
there02other02men02were02living,02utterly02unlike02those02here;02
there02time02itself02seemed02to02stand02still,02as02though02the02age02of02
Abraham02and02his02flocks02had02not02passed.02Raskolnikov02sat02
gazing,02 his02 thoughts02 passed02
into02 day\dreams,02
into02
contemplation;02he02thought02of02nothing,02but02a02vague02
restlessness02excited02and02troubled02him.02Suddenly02he02found02
Sonia02beside02him;02she02had02come02up02noiselessly02and02sat02
down02at02his02side.02It02was02still02quite02early;02the02morning02chill02
was02still02keen.02She02wore02her02poor02old02burnous02and02the02
green02shawl;02her02face02still02showed02signs02of02illness,02it02was02
thinner02and02paler.02She02gave02him02a02joyful02smile02of02welcome,02
but02held02out02her02hand02with02her02usual02timidity.02She02was02
always02timid02of02holding02out02her02hand02to02him02and02
sometimes02did02not02offer02it02at02all,02as02though02afraid02he02would02
repel02it.02He02always02took02her02hand02as02though02with02
repugnance,02always02seemed02vexed02to02meet02her02and02was02
sometimes02 obstinately02 silent02
throughout02 her02 visit.02
Sometimes02she02trembled02before02him02and02went02away02
deeply02grieved.02But02now02their02hands02did02not02part.02He02stole02
a02rapid02glance02at02her02and02dropped02his02eyes02on02the02ground02
without02speaking.02They02were02alone,02no02one02had02seen02them.02
The02guard02had02turned02away02for02the02time.0202
How02it02happened02he02did02not02know.02But02all02at02once02
something02seemed02to02seize02him02and02fling02him02at02her02feet.02
He02wept02and02threw02his02arms02round02her02knees.02For02the02first02
instant02she02was02terribly02frightened02and02she02turned02pale.02
She02jumped02up02and02looked02at02him02trembling.02But02at02the02
same02moment02she02understood,02and02a02light02of02infinite02
happiness02came02into02her02eyes.02She02knew02and02had02no02doubt02
that02he02loved02her02beyond02everything02and02that02at02last02the02
moment02had02come....0202
They02wanted02to02speak,02but02could02not;02tears02stood02in02
their02eyes.02They02were02both02pale02and02thin;02but02those02sick02
pale02faces02were02bright02with02the02dawn02of02a02new02future,02of02a02
full02resurrection02into02a02new02life.02They02were02renewed02by02
love;02the02heart02of02each02held02infinite02sources02of02life02for02the02
heart02of02the02other.0202
They02resolved02to02wait02and02be02patient.02They02had02another02
seven02years02to02wait,02and02what02terrible02suffering02and02what02
infinite02happiness02before02them!02But02he02had02risen02again02and02
he02knew02it02and02felt02it02in02all02his02being,02while02she―she02only02
lived02in02his02life.0202
On02the02evening02of02the02same02day,02when02the02barracks02
were02locked,02Raskolnikov02lay02on02his02plank02bed02and02thought02
of02her.02He02had02even02fancied02that02day02that02all02the02convicts02
who02had02been02his02enemies02looked02at02him02differently;02he02

He02thought02of02her.02He02remembered02how02continually02he02

tormented02 her02 and02 wounded02 her02 heart.02 He02
remembered02her02pale02and02thin02little02face.02But02these02
recollections02scarcely02troubled02him02now;02he02knew02with02
what02infinite02love02he02would02now02repay02all02her02sufferings.02
And02what02were02all,02all02the02agonies02of02the02past!02Everything,02
even02his02crime,02his02sentence02and02imprisonment,02seemed02to02
him02now02in02the02first02rush02of02feeling02an02external,02strange02
fact02with02which02he02had02no02concern.02But02he02could02not02think02
for02long02together02of02anything02that02evening,02and02he02could02
not02have02analysed02anything02consciously;02he02was02simply02
feeling.02Life02had02stepped02into02the02place02of02theory02and02
something02quite02different02would02work02itself02out02in02his02
mind.0202Under02his02pillow02lay02the02New02Testament.02He02took02it02up02

from02which02she02had02read02the02raising02of02Lazarus02to02him.02At02

religion,02would02talk02about02the02gospel02and02pester02him02with02
books.02But02to02his02great02surprise02she02had02not02once02

Till02now02he02had02not02opened02it.0202
He02did02not02open02it02now,02but02one02thought02passed02
through02his02mind:02"Can02her02convictions02not02be02mine02now?02
Her02feelings,02her02aspirations02at02least...."0202
She02too02had02been02greatly02agitated02that02day,02and02at02night02
she02was02taken02ill02again.02But02she02was02so02happy―and02so02
unexpectedly02happy―that02she02was02almost02frightened02of02
her02happiness.02Seven02years,02 only02seven02years!02At02the02
beginning02of02their02happiness02at02some02moments02they02were02
both02ready02to02look02on02those02seven02years02as02though02they02
